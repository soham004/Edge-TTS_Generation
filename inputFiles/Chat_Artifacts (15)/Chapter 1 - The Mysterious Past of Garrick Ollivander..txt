Chapter 1: The Mysterious Past of Garrick Ollivander.

Oh, a new visitor from the woods. Welcome. Are you a lost wanderer, tired from a long journey? Then join me, sit beside the fireplace, and let me tell you some stories that may soothe your mood as you regain your strength.

You all set? Good. Let's start the story with the enigmatic wandmaker whose slender fingers have crafted the conduits of magic for countless witches and wizards across Britain. A man who remembers every wand he has ever sold, and whose silvery eyes seem to peer not just at you, but through you, into the very essence of your magical potential.

Garrick Ollivander's origins stretch back far beyond the quaint little shop at Diagon Alley where many young witches and wizards first experience the thrill of finding their perfect magical match. The Ollivander family's wandmaking tradition dates back to 382 B.C., making them one of the oldest wizarding families in Britain with a continuous craft. Their Roman ancestry is reflected in their name—"Ollivander" is believed to be a corruption of the Latin phrase meaning "he who owns the olive wand," suggesting their early experimentation with olive wood, though this material would later be abandoned for more magically conducive woods.

Imagine walking through ancient Rome, where a young Ollivander ancestor might have crafted wands in secret, during times when magic was both revered and feared. The family knowledge passed down through generations, each wandmaker adding their observations, their discoveries, their unique understanding of the mysterious connection between wand and wizard.

Garrick himself was born to Gervaise Ollivander, a respected wandmaker in his own right, who had maintained the family's reputation for excellence. Young Garrick showed an exceptional sensitivity to magic from an early age. It is said that he could sense the magical properties of different woods simply by touch, a rare gift even among wandmakers. Picture a small boy with wide, curious eyes, running his fingers over various wood samples in his father's workshop, identifying rowan from ash, cherry from maple, without ever looking at them.

As he grew, Garrick's education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry only deepened his fascination with the art of wandmaking. A Ravenclaw, naturally—his brilliant mind and creativity found a home in the house of wisdom. During his school years, he would spend hours in the library, researching ancient wandlore texts, many of which had been written by his own ancestors. The Restricted Section held particular allure for him, with its tomes on the deepest aspects of wand magic, some bordering on the forbidden.

Upon graduation, Garrick apprenticed under his father, as was tradition in the Ollivander family. But unlike many who simply follow in their parents' footsteps, Garrick was determined to revolutionize wandmaking. The workshop became his laboratory, where he conducted countless experiments on wand cores and woods, seeking the perfect combinations that would create the most powerful and responsive wands.

It was Garrick who refined the family practice to focus exclusively on three supreme cores: dragon heartstring, phoenix feather, and unicorn hair. Before him, Ollivanders had used a wider variety of cores, including Veela hair, which Garrick deemed "temperamental." His decision to limit the cores was not based on convenience or tradition, but on years of careful observation and experimentation. He believed these three cores produced the most consistent, powerful, and reliable wands.

Picture the young wandmaker, working late into the night by candlelight, carefully extracting a silver-white unicorn hair and placing it inside a precisely carved channel in a length of cypress wood. His slender fingers, already developing the permanent calluses that would mark him as a master craftsman, sealing the wand with ancient spells, his voice a whisper in the otherwise silent shop.

Ollivander's revolutionary approach extended beyond cores to the relationship between wand and wizard. While many wandmakers before him had crafted wands to order, designing them for specific customers, Garrick firmly established the philosophy that "the wand chooses the wizard." This seemingly simple idea represented a profound shift in wandlore—recognizing wands as quasi-sentient entities with preferences and affinities of their own.

The shop at Number 7, Diagon Alley, which Garrick inherited from his father, became a place of wonder and sometimes trepidation for young witches and wizards. Imagine stepping inside for the first time, the bell above the door announcing your arrival with a gentle chime. The air heavy with dust and magic, thousands of narrow boxes piled high to the ceiling. And there, emerging from the shadows, the wandmaker himself with those unsettling silvery eyes that seem to evaluate your very soul.

Ollivander's memory became as legendary as his craftsmanship. He could recall every wand he had ever sold—not just the specifications, but the witch or wizard who purchased it. Years could pass between encounters, yet he would greet returning customers with details of their wand purchase as if it had happened just yesterday. This remarkable ability served him well in his craft but also made him an invaluable, if sometimes reluctant, source of information during both Wizarding Wars.

Indeed, the wars cast dark shadows over Ollivander's long life. During the First Wizarding War, he likely lived in fear of what his creations were being used to accomplish in the hands of Death Eaters. For a wandmaker who believed so deeply in the bond between wand and wizard, it must have been agonizing to know that wands he had crafted with love and care were being used to torture and kill.

But it was the Second Wizarding War that brought Ollivander directly into the conflict. In the summer of 1996, he vanished from his shop, leaving behind signs of a struggle. The wizarding community was shocked and alarmed—Ollivanders had been a constant presence on Diagon Alley for centuries, and its sudden closure represented a frightening escalation in the war.

Picture the abandoned shop, dust gathering on the countertops where once eager young witches and wizards had stood trembling with excitement. The thousands of wand boxes, each containing a potential magical partnership, left untouched in the darkness. On the street outside, witches and wizards would hurry past the darkened windows, casting uneasy glances at the shop that had been a cornerstone of magical Britain for generations.

The truth, as Harry Potter and his friends would eventually discover, was that Ollivander had been kidnapped by Lord Voldemort himself. The Dark Lord sought information about the strange connection between his wand and Harry Potter's—the twin cores of phoenix feather, both from Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes. This rare phenomenon, known as Priori Incantatem, had saved Harry during their confrontation in the graveyard after the Triwizard Tournament.

Imagine Ollivander held captive in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, his slender frame grown even thinner, his silvery eyes dulled by fear and poor treatment. The wandmaker, who had spent his life creating instruments of magic and wonder, forced to provide knowledge that would help the darkest wizard of all time extend his reign of terror.

Voldemort also demanded information about the Elder Wand, the legendary unbeatable wand from "The Tale of the Three Brothers." Ollivander admitted to the Dark Lord that he had never personally examined the Elder Wand but believed it to exist. This information set Voldemort on his quest to locate and claim the wand, ultimately leading him to desecrate Albus Dumbledore's tomb.

During his captivity, Ollivander was forced to create a new wand for Peter Pettigrew and later, after Voldemort appropriated Lucius Malfoy's wand (which was subsequently destroyed in the chase from Privet Drive), he was made to analyze why the borrowed wand had failed against Harry Potter. His inability to provide satisfactory answers nearly cost him his life.

After months of imprisonment, Ollivander was rescued by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, along with Luna Lovegood, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook. He recovered at Shell Cottage, the home of Bill and Fleur Weasley, where he crafted new wands for Luna and Dean to replace those they had lost during their own capture.

Even in his weakened state, recovering from months of mistreatment, the wandmaker continued his craft. Picture him sitting by a window overlooking the sea, the salt breeze bringing some color back to his pallid cheeks as his fingers, still deft despite everything, carefully work a length of wood, his expression one of deep concentration and, perhaps, relief at being able to create rather than destroy.

After the war, it is believed that Ollivander returned to his shop in Diagon Alley, though whether he fully resumed his business remains uncertain. Some sources suggest he may have trained an apprentice or family member to continue the Ollivander tradition, passing on the centuries of knowledge that he carried.

Throughout his long career, Ollivander developed something of a reputation for his fascination with unusual and powerful wand combinations. He was known to sometimes create wands that even he considered dangerous in their potential—such as the yew and phoenix feather wand that chose Tom Riddle, later known as Lord Voldemort. After selling that particular wand, Ollivander would later remark to Harry Potter that he had expected the owner to do "great things... terrible, yes, but great."

This raises intriguing questions about Ollivander's personal philosophy regarding wandmaking and magic. Did he view his role simply as a facilitator, creating tools without moral judgment about their use? Or did he perhaps believe that the greatest magic, even dark magic, represented important aspects of wizarding achievement? The wandmaker himself never clearly addressed these questions, maintaining an air of professional neutrality that only deepened his mysterious reputation.

What we do know is that Ollivander approached wandmaking as both an art and a science. He conducted careful experiments throughout his career, constantly seeking to refine his understanding of how different woods and cores interact, how the length and flexibility of a wand reflect the character and magical style of its owner, and how wands develop their own loyalties and preferences over time.

His contributions to wandlore extended beyond his craftsmanship. Ollivander wrote extensively on the subject, documenting his findings for future generations of wandmakers. Some of his papers on the properties of different wand woods are considered definitive texts in the field, describing in meticulous detail how woods from ash to yew interact with different magical temperaments.

As we draw our exploration of Garrick Ollivander to a close, take a moment to imagine him in his dusty shop, surrounded by thousands of wands, each containing potential magic waiting to be unleashed by the right witch or wizard. His thin face illuminated by a single lamp as night falls over Diagon Alley, carefully measuring a length of wood or noting down observations in a leather-bound journal that will one day join countless others in the Ollivander archives.

In many ways, Ollivander represents the mysterious heart of wandlore itself—this ancient magical discipline that connects witch and wizard to their magical ability through a deeply personal instrument. His life's work reminds us that magic, at its core, is about connections and partnerships—between wizard and wand, between craft and creativity, between knowledge preserved from the past and innovations for the future.

As you drift toward sleep, consider this: If you were to step into Ollivander's shop tomorrow, what wand might choose you? What would those silvery eyes see in you that would guide him to bring down just the right narrow box from his towering shelves? And what might that choice reveal about the magic that lies within you, waiting to be awakened?
