Chapter 9: The Gaunt Shack.

Hidden histories sometimes linger in the most unassuming places, their significance concealed beneath layers of decay and neglect. As our evening journey continues, let us venture along an overgrown path in Little Hangleton to a crumbling structure almost swallowed by the forest—a place where ancient bloodlines, terrible secrets, and the seeds of wizarding war all converged: the Gaunt Shack.

Just beyond the well-kept hedges and manicured gardens of the village, where the forest begins to claim the land in earnest, stood a small cottage that time and care had long abandoned. To pass it while walking, one might mistake it for nothing more than a particularly large pile of mossy stones or a peculiar natural formation among the trees. Only upon closer inspection would the rotting door become apparent, often adorned with a grim trophy—a snake nailed to the wood, a disturbing herald of the dwelling's inhabitants.

The Gaunt Shack represented a striking juxtaposition in the wizarding world—a family of the most ancient and supposedly pure magical lineage, direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin himself, living in conditions of abject poverty and squalor. The noble house of Gaunt, once powerful and respected, had dwindled through generations of insularity, poor decisions, and an increasing obsession with blood purity that led them to marry only within an ever-narrowing circle of relatives.

Imagine the interior of the shack as it stood in the early twentieth century, when Marvolo Gaunt resided there with his two children, Morfin and Merope. The single room served as kitchen, living area, and sleeping quarters for all three family members. The floor, originally wooden, had accumulated so much dirt and detritus that it more closely resembled packed earth. What little furniture remained—a table, a few chairs, a single bed—was broken and decaying, held together more by habit than by craftsmanship.

Windows, their glass long since broken, were covered with rags or simply left open to the elements. In winter, the bitter cold would seep through every surface; in summer, the heat would make the small space almost unbearable. A fireplace provided meager warmth and cooking facilities, though the chimney functioned poorly, leaving the interior perpetually smoky and sooty.

Yet amidst this desperate poverty gleamed incongruous treasures—heirlooms of the Gaunt family's once-grand status. Marvolo Gaunt possessed two items of extraordinary magical significance: a ring set with a black stone that bore a curious symbol (unknown to the Gaunts themselves, this was the Resurrection Stone, one of the legendary Deathly Hallows) and a heavy gold locket emblazoned with the serpentine "S" of Salazar Slytherin.

These treasures, particularly the locket, were Marvolo's only source of pride. He would brandish them as proof of the family's noble lineage while raging against their reduced circumstances, never acknowledging that generations of poor management, magical degradation from inbreeding, and refusal to engage with the wider world had brought them to such a state.

The atmosphere within the shack was one of perpetual tension and occasional violence. Marvolo, embittered by the family's decline and consumed with delusions of grandeur, ruled his small kingdom with cruelty. His son Morfin, physically and perhaps mentally affected by the family's inbreeding, spoke primarily in Parseltongue—the rare ability to communicate with serpents that had been passed down through their Slytherin ancestry. Merope, the daughter, lived in a state of constant fear and subjugation, serving as little more than a house-elf to her father and brother.

It was in this environment of decay and dysfunction that an event occurred that would ultimately shape the course of wizarding history. Tom Riddle, a handsome young Muggle from the manor house overlooking the village, rode past the shack one summer day. Merope, who had secretly watched him for years, was seen by her brother, who attacked Riddle for attracting his sister's attention. This incident brought Ministry officials to the shack, resulting in the arrest and imprisonment of both Marvolo and Morfin.

Left alone for the first time in her life, Merope seized her opportunity. Whether through a love potion, as many believe, or through other magical means, she ensnared Tom Riddle. They eloped, leaving the shack abandoned for a time. Their union would produce a son, Tom Marvolo Riddle—the boy who would one day style himself Lord Voldemort.

Merope never returned to the shack. After Riddle abandoned her when she stopped using magic to keep him, she sold the precious Slytherin locket for a pittance and died giving birth to her son in a London orphanage. Morfin, however, did return after his release from Azkaban, living alone in the increasingly dilapidated dwelling. The years wore on, and the shack fell further into ruin, becoming a place the villagers avoided, with whispered stories of the strange, snake-obsessed hermit who lived within.

It was to this decaying hovel that a teenage Tom Riddle came in search of his wizarding heritage. Having discovered his connection to the Gaunts, he sought out his uncle Morfin, finding him living in conditions even worse than before—surrounded by filth, barely distinguishable from the squalor of his surroundings. In a conversation conducted partly in Parseltongue, Riddle learned of his parentage and the existence of his Muggle father who still lived in the grand house on the hill.

What followed was a series of terrible events: Riddle stole Morfin's wand, modified his uncle's memories, murdered his father and paternal grandparents in their home, and then returned to the shack to steal the Gaunt ring. Morfin, with implanted memories and his wand showing evidence of the killings, confessed to the murders and returned to Azkaban, where he would die still believing himself guilty.

The Gaunt ring, now in Riddle's possession, would years later become one of his Horcruxes—receptacles for fragments of his soul, created through the supreme act of evil that is murder. After creating this Horcrux, Riddle concealed the ring beneath the floorboards of the abandoned shack, surrounding it with powerful enchantments and curses designed to kill anyone who might discover and attempt to claim it.

For decades thereafter, the Gaunt Shack stood empty, sinking further into decay, its roof partially collapsed, its walls crumbling. The forest began to reclaim the small clearing, vines and underbrush growing up through the floor and around the remaining structure. To Muggle eyes, if any ventured so far from the village paths, it would appear to be nothing more than the ruins of a long-abandoned gamekeeper's hut, not worth a second glance.

Yet the shack remained significant in wizarding history, though few knew of its existence or importance. It was here, many years after Riddle had hidden his Horcrux, that Albus Dumbledore came seeking. Having pieced together fragments of Tom Riddle's history through painstaking investigation, the Hogwarts headmaster identified the shack as a likely hiding place for one of Voldemort's soul fragments.

Imagine Dumbledore approaching the ruins on a summer evening, his wand illuminating the path through the dense forest. The structure, barely recognizable as a dwelling by this point, would have appeared empty and unremarkable—yet Dumbledore sensed the powerful magic concealed within. With extraordinary skill, he navigated the protective enchantments Voldemort had placed around the shack, eventually discovering the loose floorboard beneath which the ring was hidden.

What happened next would have significant consequences. The ring, bearing not only a fragment of Voldemort's soul but also the Resurrection Stone—one of the Deathly Hallows that Dumbledore had sought in his youth—proved too great a temptation. Whether overcome by the desire to use the Stone to speak with his dead family members or influenced by the ring's curse, Dumbledore placed it on his finger.

The powerful curse activated immediately, beginning to kill him in an excruciating manner. Only Dumbledore's immense magical skill allowed him to contain the curse temporarily and return to Hogwarts, where Professor Snape managed to limit the curse to Dumbledore's hand. Even so, both wizards knew the curse would eventually spread and kill the headmaster—giving them a timeframe of perhaps a year to complete their plans against Voldemort.

After retrieving the ring and destroying the Horcrux within it using the Sword of Gryffindor, Dumbledore left the shack for the final time. What remained of the structure continued its slow collapse into the forest floor, its dark history known to very few in the wizarding world.

Today, little likely remains of the Gaunt Shack. The wooden elements would have rotted away completely, and even the stone foundations would be buried beneath years of fallen leaves and forest growth. Without knowing exactly where to look, a visitor to Little Hangleton would find no trace of the dwelling that housed the last descendants of Slytherin and played such a pivotal role in the rise of the twentieth century's most dangerous Dark wizard.

Yet the story of the Gaunt Shack serves as a powerful reminder of how grand histories can be concealed in humble places, and how the consequences of choices made in obscurity can eventually reshape the wider world. The shack embodied the tragic decline of the once-noble House of Gaunt—their pride and obsession with blood purity ultimately leading to poverty, madness, and the birth of a wizard who would take their twisted values to their logical and terrible conclusion.

As our exploration of this forgotten place concludes, one might reflect on the irony that Voldemort, who despised his humble origins and sought power and immortality above all else, chose to hide a piece of his fractured soul in the very symbol of what he most wanted to escape—the squalid reminder of his mother's impoverished magical lineage. What might this reveal about the hidden connections between our origins and our destinies, and the futility of attempting to sever ourselves completely from the roots that helped to shape us?
