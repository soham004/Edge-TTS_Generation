Chapter 9: The Transformation of Tom Riddle.

The flames have burned to glowing embers now, casting strange shadows across the room as we turn to one of the darkest chapters in wizarding history. Tonight, we shall trace the path of a boy named Tom Marvolo Riddle – a child born of a love potion's false enchantment, raised without affection in a Muggle orphanage, who would transform himself through terrible magic and terrible deeds into Lord Voldemort, the most feared Dark wizard of modern times. This is not a tale to frighten, but rather to understand – for in the twisted journey from abandoned child to Dark Lord lie insights into the nature of power, choice, and the human capacity for both extraordinary magic and extraordinary cruelty.

Our story begins on a cold New Year's Eve in 1926, in a bleak London orphanage where a young woman named Merope Gaunt arrived in the final stages of labor. Weakened by months of deprivation and heartbreak after the departure of her husband Tom Riddle Sr. (a Muggle she had ensnared with love potions), Merope had sufficient strength only to deliver her son and name him before succumbing to death – her final words expressing hope that he would resemble his handsome father. This hope would be granted in physical appearance, though in character, the child would ultimately embody the worst aspects of the Gaunt family's dark legacy.

The early years of Tom Riddle's life unfolded in the institutional coldness of Wool's Orphanage. Even as a very young child, caretakers noted unusual incidents surrounding him – toys that moved without being touched, animals that seemed to fear him, and other children who mysteriously suffered accidents after disagreements with the quiet, handsome boy. By the age of seven, Tom had developed conscious control over these abilities, using them deliberately to frighten or punish those who crossed him. Most disturbingly, he seemed to take pleasure in his power over others, collecting small trophies from his victims as mementos of these victories.

The arrival of Albus Dumbledore at the orphanage in the summer of 1938 marked a pivotal moment in Riddle's life. Dumbledore, then the Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts, came to inform eleven-year-old Tom of his acceptance to the school and his true nature as a wizard. Their first meeting revealed much about the boy Riddle had become – distrustful, self-reliant, and already harboring a disturbing desire for power and specialness. When Dumbledore demonstrated magic by setting Riddle's wardrobe temporarily aflame, the boy's reaction was not wonder but an immediate demand to learn how to do the same. More tellingly, when confronted about his bullying of other children, Riddle showed neither remorse nor fear, but rather a calculating assessment of how much Dumbledore knew and how it might affect his future.

Despite these concerning signs, Dumbledore arranged for Riddle to attend Hogwarts, perhaps hoping that proper magical education and the community of the school might guide the troubled child toward a more positive path. In September 1938, Tom Riddle boarded the Hogwarts Express, leaving behind the Muggle world he had come to despise, carrying with him only his secondhand school supplies and an innate magical talent that would soon prove exceptional.

The Sorting Hat's decision to place Riddle in Slytherin House proved consequential in shaping his development. Among the children of ancient wizarding families, many harboring pureblood supremacist views, Riddle initially faced prejudice for his unknown parentage and apparent Muggle surname. Rather than breaking his spirit, however, this merely strengthened his determination to prove himself superior. He devoted himself to academic excellence, cultivated a carefully charming persona for teachers and selected peers, and began his systematic exploration of Hogwarts' secrets – particularly those relating to his growing obsession: Salazar Slytherin and his Chamber of Secrets.

Riddle's academic performance proved nothing short of brilliant. Teachers, with the notable exception of the persistently wary Dumbledore, praised his intelligence, magical aptitude, and apparent thirst for knowledge. He received perfect marks in all examinations, served as a prefect and later Head Boy, and was widely considered the most promising student Hogwarts had seen in generations. This public façade of the perfect student concealed his true activities – nocturnal explorations of the castle's hidden areas, research into the darkest aspects of magic, and the gradual gathering of followers attracted to his growing power.

The discovery of his own heritage marked another critical turning point in Riddle's evolution. Through diligent research in old school records and wizarding genealogies, he uncovered his connection to Salazar Slytherin through his mother's family, the Gaunts. This revelation transformed his self-perception – no longer was he merely a talented orphan of unknown parentage, but the heir to one of wizarding history's most significant figures. The knowledge fueled both his growing sense of entitlement and his contempt for his Muggle father, who had abandoned his witch mother before his birth.

During his fifth year at Hogwarts, Riddle located the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets – fulfilling what he saw as his birthright as Slytherin's heir. His ability to speak Parseltongue, inherited through the Gaunt line, allowed him to command the deadly Basilisk that had lain dormant within the Chamber for centuries. Rather than revealing his discovery publicly, Riddle chose to use the monster strategically, targeting Muggle-born students in a calculated campaign of terror. When the death of a student named Myrtle Warren (who would later become known as Moaning Myrtle) threatened the closure of Hogwarts, Riddle framed fellow student Rubeus Hagrid for the attacks, preserving both the school and his own pristine reputation.

It was during this period that Tom Riddle began experimenting with the darkest forms of magic – particularly the creation of Horcruxes, magical objects containing fragments of a wizard's soul, created through the supreme act of evil: murder. His first Horcrux, created with Myrtle Warren's death, was his own diary – an item that would later play a crucial role in reopening the Chamber of Secrets fifty years later. This act marked Riddle's first deliberate step toward magical immortality, a goal that would increasingly consume him in the years to come.

The summer following his discovery of the Chamber, Riddle traced his paternal relatives to the village of Little Hangleton. There, he came face to face with both the Muggle father who had abandoned him and the impoverished remnants of his mother's family in the person of Morfin Gaunt, his uncle. The encounter culminated in Riddle's murder of his father and paternal grandparents, a crime for which he framed his uncle by modifying Morfin's memories. Using the Gaunt family ring he took from Morfin, Riddle created his second Horcrux, further fracturing his soul in his pursuit of immortality.

Returning to Hogwarts for his final years, Riddle intensified his efforts to gather information about the most taboo magical practices. He cultivated relationships with professors who possessed specialized knowledge, most notably Horace Slughorn, from whom he extracted crucial information about the possibility of creating multiple Horcruxes. His apparent thirst for academic knowledge concealed his true purpose – the systematic acquisition of magical lore that would serve his ambition for power and immortality.

Upon graduation, Riddle surprised many by declining numerous prestigious job offers from the Ministry of Magic and other magical institutions. Instead, he took a position at Borgin and Burkes, a shop in Knockturn Alley specializing in Dark magical objects and artifacts. This seemingly modest career choice served several purposes – it allowed him to identify and acquire powerful magical objects, to make connections with Dark wizards and collectors, and to maintain a low profile while he continued developing his plans for the future.

During his time at Borgin and Burkes, Riddle cultivated a relationship with Hepzibah Smith, an elderly witch descended from Helga Hufflepuff and the owner of two priceless magical artifacts: Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket – the latter having once belonged to Riddle's own mother before poverty forced its sale. After charming his way into Smith's confidence, Riddle murdered her, stole both artifacts, and modified her house-elf's memories to take the blame. These treasures would later become his third and fourth Horcruxes, vessels for the increasingly fragmented pieces of his soul.

Following the murder of Hepzibah Smith, Tom Riddle disappeared from wizarding Britain entirely. For nearly a decade, he traveled widely, delving ever deeper into obscure and forbidden magic, particularly in Eastern Europe and ancient magical cultures where restraints on Dark magic were fewer. He studied with Dark wizards, experimented with magical transformation, and continued creating Horcruxes. Each act of murder, each splitting of his soul, diminished his humanity further – a spiritual deterioration that gradually manifested in physical changes as well.

When he finally returned to Britain, Tom Riddle had become nearly unrecognizable. His once handsome features had grown waxy and distorted, his eyes showing the first signs of the reddish glow they would eventually possess. More significantly, he had abandoned his birth name entirely, now calling himself Lord Voldemort – an anagram of "Tom Marvolo Riddle" that proclaimed "I Am Lord Voldemort," severing his connection to his Muggle father and creating an identity aligned with his perception of his own greatness.

The transformation complete, Voldemort began gathering followers – the Death Eaters – from among those who shared his views on blood purity or were simply attracted to his growing power. Many came from Slytherin families he had known during his Hogwarts years, forming the nucleus of what would become a movement dedicated to purging the wizarding world of Muggle-borns and establishing magical dominance over Muggles. Through a combination of ideological appeal, fear, and promises of power, Voldemort built a force that would soon threaten the entire wizarding world.

Around 1970, Voldemort made one final attempt to secure a position at Hogwarts, applying to Dumbledore (now Headmaster) for the Defense Against the Dark Arts teaching post. His motives were complex – partly to access Hogwarts and its resources for further research, partly to influence young witches and wizards, and partly to acquire an item he sought for his final planned Horcrux. Dumbledore, recognizing the darkness that had fully consumed his former student, refused the application. In response, Voldemort cursed the position, ensuring that no Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher would remain at Hogwarts for more than a year – a curse that would hold for decades to come.

With his transformation from troubled orphan to Dark Lord complete, Voldemort launched the campaign of terror that would become the First Wizarding War. His physical appearance continued to deteriorate, reflecting the damage to his soul caused by multiple Horcruxes and immersion in the darkest forms of magic. The handsome boy who had once charmed teachers and peers alike was gone entirely, replaced by a figure whose serpentine features and glowing red eyes embodied the inhumanity he had embraced in his quest for power and immortality.

The tragedy of Tom Riddle lies not in his innate nature but in his choices. While his childhood was undeniably bleak – born of a loveless union, abandoned before birth, raised without affection – many others have endured similar or worse circumstances without turning to darkness. At each crossroads, Riddle chose the path that led away from humanity and toward power. He rejected friendship in favor of followers, compassion in favor of control, and ultimately sacrificed his very soul on the altar of his ambition.

Perhaps most revealing is what Riddle feared above all else: death, the ultimate equalizer that would render meaningless all his striving for power and specialness. This fear drove his creation of Horcruxes, his pursuit of the Elder Wand, and ultimately his obsessive targeting of Harry Potter – the boy who had somehow survived his Killing Curse. In this fear, we see not the towering Dark Lord of wizarding nightmares, but the frightened orphan still raging against the limitations of human existence, still desperately trying to prove himself exceptional.

As our tale of transformation concludes, consider the path from Tom Riddle to Lord Voldemort as a series of choices rather than an inevitable destiny. What moments of decision shaped his journey toward darkness? What opportunities for a different path did he encounter and reject? And perhaps most importantly, what does his tragedy reveal about the nature of power when divorced from love, from empathy, from the very humanity that gives magic its deepest meaning and purpose?
