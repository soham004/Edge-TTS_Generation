Chapter 4: The Friendship of Lily Evans and Severus Snape.

In the gentle twilight that now surrounds us, let us turn our attention to a tale of childhood friendship, a bond forged in the wonder of magical discovery but ultimately fractured by the weight of choices and circumstances. The story of Lily Evans and Severus Snape begins like many great wizarding tales – in the ordinary world of Muggles, where magic reveals itself in unexpected moments to those with the gift to perceive it.

In the industrial town of Cokeworth, amid brick houses and smoking factory chimneys, two children from vastly different homes found connection through their shared difference from those around them. Young Severus Snape, with his ill-fitting clothes and watchful eyes, had grown up in the shadow of tension at Spinner's End, where magic and Muggle worlds collided uncomfortably in his parents' discordant marriage. His mother, Eileen Prince, a witch who had seemingly surrendered her magical heritage to a life of mundane unhappiness, and his father Tobias, a Muggle whose resentment manifested in neglect and occasional cruelty, created an environment where young Severus learned early to observe carefully and speak little.

Not far away lived the Evans family – thoroughly Muggle but warm and supportive, with two daughters as different as sunlight and shadow. Petunia, the elder, embraced the ordinary with determined enthusiasm, while her younger sister Lily possessed an unusual vitality and curiosity that seemed to hover just beyond the boundaries of the conventional world. It was this quality that first caught Severus's attention as he watched her play in the local park, her laughter carrying across the worn grass and gravel paths.

Their first true meeting came when Severus, who had been watching Lily secretly for some time, could no longer contain his knowledge. Having observed her performing unconscious magic – making flowers open and close their petals, floating gently off a swing at its highest point – he finally approached her. With the awkward directness of childhood, he informed her of what she was: a witch, like his mother, capable of wonders that her Muggle sister could never achieve.

This revelation might have been received with fear or disbelief, but Lily Evans possessed a rare openness to the extraordinary. Though initially defensive at what she perceived as an insult, her natural curiosity quickly overcame this reaction. Here was an explanation for the strange occurrences that had surrounded her throughout childhood, the small miracles that had both delighted and sometimes isolated her from her peers. In Severus, she found not only answers but a companion who understood the experience of being different in ways no one else in her life could comprehend.

For Severus, the friendship offered something equally precious – acceptance without judgment, warmth without condition, and most significantly, a connection to the magical world that existed beyond his unhappy home. In the vibrant, kind-hearted girl with the startling green eyes, he found both refuge and possibility. Their conversations in hidden corners of the park or by the small river that wound through the town became a lifeline, hours filled with Severus sharing everything he knew about the wizarding world while Lily listened with endless questions and bright enthusiasm.

Imagine them sitting together beneath a large oak tree, its leaves casting dappled shadows across their faces. Severus explains about Hogwarts – the four houses, the moving staircases, the Great Hall with its enchanted ceiling that reflects the sky outside. His usually guarded expression softens as he describes the Potions classroom, already his favorite subject through his mother's old textbooks hidden under a loose floorboard in his room. Lily leans forward, her eyes wide, occasionally interrupting with questions that reveal her quick intelligence and thoughtful nature.

"But what if I can't do any of it?" she asks suddenly, a rare moment of vulnerability breaking through her usual confidence. "What if I get there and it turns out I'm not magical enough?"

Severus shakes his head with unusual certainty. "That's impossible. I've seen what you can do without even trying. Just wait until you have a wand and proper training." His voice carries absolute conviction – perhaps the first time in his young life he has spoken without doubt or hesitation.

Their anticipation of Hogwarts bound them even more closely. Both awaited their eleventh birthdays and the arrival of their acceptance letters with a mixture of impatience and, in Lily's case, lingering uncertainty about whether Severus's assurances would prove true. When her letter finally arrived, delivered by a barn owl to the profound shock of her parents and the bitter jealousy of her sister, it was to Severus she ran first with the news, the parchment clutched tightly in her hand like a talisman.

The journey to Diagon Alley marked another milestone in their friendship. For Lily, it was the first tangible proof of the world Severus had described – the crooked buildings housing shops filled with cauldrons, spell books, and ingredients with names she could barely pronounce. For Severus, seeing the wonder in her eyes as she experienced these familiar concepts made them fresh again, temporarily banishing the cynicism that had already begun to take root in his young heart.

Their wand selections particularly highlighted the differences in their natures. Lily's wand – ten and a quarter inches, willow, swishy and excellent for charm work – chose her almost immediately, emitting a shower of golden sparks that made her laugh with delight. Severus's process was longer, more deliberate, several wands rejected before finding his match in a rigid, dark instrument that suited his precise and increasingly controlled demeanor.

It was on the Hogwarts Express, however, that the first shadow fell across their friendship. Their encounter with James Potter and Sirius Black in a shared compartment introduced a tension that would eventually grow into an insurmountable rift. The casual arrogance of the two boys, their immediate dismissal of Severus's desire to be sorted into Slytherin, created an instant antipathy that would only deepen with time. Lily, loyal to her friend, departed with Severus to find another compartment, but the seed of future conflict had been planted.

The Sorting Hat's decision to place them in different houses – Gryffindor for Lily, Slytherin for Severus – created the first real distance between them. Though they maintained their friendship despite house rivalries, meeting in the library to study, finding quiet corners of the grounds to continue their conversations, the separate paths of their daily lives began to pull them in different directions. New friendships formed, new influences exerted themselves, and the unified world they had created in their hometown began to fragment into the more complex reality of Hogwarts.

For Severus, Slytherin House brought both opportunity and challenge. His exceptional talent in Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts (though with a concerning interest in the Dark Arts themselves) earned him a certain respect, but his half-blood status and shabby appearance made him a target for pureblood prejudice. He found himself drawn to a group of students whose interest in the Dark Arts matched his own – Avery, Mulciber, and others who would eventually pledge themselves to Lord Voldemort. In their company, his bitterness toward the perceived injustices of his life found fertile ground in which to grow.

Lily, meanwhile, flourished in Gryffindor. Her natural warmth, intelligence, and kindness attracted friends easily, though she maintained a special compassion for those who struggled as she had once feared she might. Her talent for Charms emerged early, nurtured by Professor Flitwick's enthusiastic mentorship. She developed a particular interest in the creative aspects of magic – not just performing spells correctly but understanding how they might be improved or adapted.

As the years passed, their meetings became less frequent, their conversations more strained. Lily increasingly questioned Severus's choice of companions and his growing fascination with Dark magic. Severus harbored deepening resentment toward James Potter, whose obvious attraction to Lily and persistent bullying cut to the core of his insecurities. What had once been a friendship characterized by open sharing became punctuated by arguments, reconciliations, and growing periods of silence.

The breaking point came during their fifth year, after a particularly humiliating episode where James Potter publicly tormented Severus near the lake after their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. exam. When Lily intervened on his behalf, Severus's humiliation and rage culminated in a moment of unforgivable cruelty – he called her "Mudblood," the most offensive term for a Muggle-born witch or wizard. Though he immediately regretted his words, the damage was irrevocable. The slur revealed something that had been changing within him, a willingness to embrace ideologies fundamentally at odds with what Lily represented.

That night, Severus waited outside the Gryffindor common room, desperate to apologize. Lily emerged only because the portrait of the Fat Lady informed her someone was threatening to sleep there if she didn't appear. Their final conversation as friends was brief and heartbreaking – Severus pleading for forgiveness, Lily acknowledging that this moment was merely the culmination of paths they had been walking for years. His friends, his interests, his ambitions had been taking him away from her long before the word left his lips.

"You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine," she told him, her green eyes reflecting not anger but a deep sadness. With those words, the friendship that had introduced both of them to the wizarding world effectively ended.

In the years that followed, their lives diverged completely. Lily eventually began dating James Potter, whose persistent pursuit finally succeeded when he demonstrated genuine change and maturity. After Hogwarts, they married and joined the Order of the Phoenix, standing openly against the rising power of Lord Voldemort. Severus, meanwhile, fully embraced the Death Eater cause, his exceptional talents making him a valuable servant to the Dark Lord.

Yet the memory of their friendship never left either of them. For Lily, it remained a bittersweet reminder of innocence and possibility, of the boy who had first shown her the wizarding world but couldn't follow her into the light. For Severus, it became both wound and talisman – his greatest regret and eventually, after her murder by Voldemort, the catalyst for his most significant choice: to turn spy for Dumbledore, to protect Lily's son at all costs, to spend the remainder of his life attempting to atone for his role in her death.

In the end, it was Lily's eyes – replicated in her son Harry – that Severus asked to see as his own life ebbed away in the Shrieking Shack, decades after their childhood days by the river. In that final moment, perhaps he returned to those simpler times, before houses and allegiances, before choices and consequences, when two children from Cokeworth discovered magic in each other's company and believed that nothing could ever come between them.

As we reflect on this complex friendship, consider how the connections we form in childhood shape us, even long after they have ended. What might have been different had Severus made different choices? Had Lily been less forgiving, or perhaps more so? In the quiet paths of memory that we all walk, which relationships have left their fingerprints upon our souls, guiding us toward who we have become even when the individuals themselves have long since departed from our lives?
