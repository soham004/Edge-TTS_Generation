Chapter 3: The Defection of Regulus Black.

Shadows gather in the corners of ancient family homes, where portraits of stern-faced ancestors watch silently from ornate frames and house-elves shuffle through darkened corridors maintaining traditions centuries old. In such shadows lived a young wizard whose brief life contained a remarkable journey from darkness into an unexpected light—a journey kept secret until long after his death. Tonight, we unravel the mystery of Regulus Arcturus Black, the Death Eater who defied the Dark Lord.

The tale of Regulus begins, as many wizarding stories do, with the matter of blood. Born in 1961 as the second son to Orion and Walburga Black, Regulus entered a family whose lineage stretched back centuries, each generation more convinced of their superiority than the last. Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpentine door fixtures and heads of house-elves mounted on the wall, was not merely a home but a monument to pureblood ideology.

Picture young Regulus in this environment—a slender boy with the same dark hair and gray eyes that marked the Black family line, absorbing the beliefs that surrounded him as naturally as breathing. Unlike his rebellious older brother Sirius, who questioned and ultimately rejected the family's values, Regulus was the model son, the pride of his parents, eager to uphold the Black family motto: "Toujours Pur"—Always Pure.

When Regulus arrived at Hogwarts in 1972, his sorting into Slytherin surprised no one. The green and silver hangings of the Slytherin common room beneath the lake became his home, where the ambient light filtered through water cast rippling patterns across ancient stone walls. Here, Regulus thrived academically and socially, becoming a Prefect and Seeker for the Slytherin Quidditch team. His peers described him as quiet but capable, loyal to his friends, and proud of his heritage without the cruelty that often accompanied such pride in others.

Meanwhile, beyond the protective walls of Hogwarts, the First Wizarding War intensified. Lord Voldemort's power grew, and his message of wizard supremacy resonated with many pureblood families, including the Blacks. By the time Regulus was sixteen, the path before him seemed predetermined—he would join the ranks of the Death Eaters, serving the Dark Lord as several of his cousins and family friends already did.

The precise details of Regulus's initiation into the Death Eaters remain obscured by time, but accounts suggest it occurred shortly after his sixteenth birthday in 1977. Imagine the ceremony—perhaps in the drawing room of Malfoy Manor, with its high ceiling and imposing chandeliers, or in some ancient stone circle under a moonless sky. The cool press of Voldemort's wand against his left forearm, the searing pain as the Dark Mark etched itself into his flesh, binding him to his new master's service.

For many young Death Eaters, receiving the Mark was a moment of triumph, the culmination of pureblood aspiration. For Regulus, we can only speculate that it represented fulfilling family expectations—becoming the son his mother could proudly display in contrast to his "blood traitor" brother. The Dark Mark upon his arm must have felt, at first, like a badge of honor, a symbol of belonging to something greater than himself.

This certainty, however, would not endure. Unlike many Death Eaters who reveled in violence and cruelty, Regulus appears to have been unprepared for the reality of Voldemort's methods. The historical record, pieced together from fragments of evidence and testimony, suggests that Regulus became increasingly disturbed by the Dark Lord's casual brutality and disregard for wizarding traditions even as he claimed to champion them.

The turning point in Regulus's allegiance came through an unexpected source: Kreacher, the Black family house-elf. In 1979, Voldemort requested from his followers the service of a house-elf. Eager to demonstrate his family's usefulness, Regulus volunteered Kreacher, instructing him to obey the Dark Lord and then return home.

What transpired next would alter Regulus's perception irreversibly. Voldemort took Kreacher to a remote seaside cave, accessible only through blood sacrifice, where a vast underground lake stretched into darkness. At the center of this lake stood a small island with a basin filled with glowing green potion—the hiding place for one of Voldemort's most precious possessions, a locket that once belonged to Salazar Slytherin.

The Dark Lord forced Kreacher to drink the potion, a brew designed to inflict unbearable suffering—burning thirst accompanied by visions of one's worst memories and fears. Once the basin was empty and the locket placed inside, Voldemort refilled it and abandoned Kreacher on the island, expecting the house-elf to die there, consumed by the Inferi—reanimated corpses—that inhabited the lake when he inevitably tried to drink from its waters.

However, Voldemort had underestimated the nature of house-elf magic and the specific instruction Regulus had given. When Kreacher had fulfilled the Dark Lord's commands, the magic binding him to Regulus's order to "return home" activated, allowing him to Disapparate from the cave despite the anti-Apparition enchantments that would have trapped a wizard.

Upon Kreacher's return, severely traumatized and relating his ordeal between sobs, something fundamental shifted within Regulus Black. The casual cruelty shown to a creature his family, for all their faults, had always treated as an extension of themselves, revealed to Regulus a truth about Voldemort he could no longer ignore: the Dark Lord cared nothing for the traditions and hierarchies he claimed to defend, viewing even his most devoted followers as disposable tools.

More significantly, Regulus began to piece together the meaning behind Voldemort's elaborate protection of the locket. His education in Ancient Runes and family heritage rich in Dark Arts knowledge led him to a terrible conclusion—Voldemort had created a Horcrux, a vessel containing a piece of his soul, one of the darkest magical artifacts possible.

For weeks after Kreacher's return, Regulus withdrew into the Black family library, its shelves heavy with forbidden texts removed from circulation centuries ago. Among moldering leather bindings and pages inscribed with runes that seemed to shift when viewed directly, he researched what he suspected. The revelation must have filled him with cold horror—not only had the Dark Lord split his soul, an act of magical sacrilege even to those who practiced the Dark Arts, but he had done so potentially multiple times, suggesting a level of magical corruption unprecedented in wizarding history.

Regulus made his decision with the quiet determination that had always characterized him. If his brother Sirius was all bold declaration and fiery defiance, Regulus was subtle calculation and measured resolve. He would not seek out the Order of the Phoenix or confess to Dumbledore. His defection would be private, known only to Kreacher, yet potentially more damaging to Voldemort than any open opposition.

On a cold evening in 1979, Regulus called Kreacher to his bedroom. The space still contained remnants of his school days—Slytherin banners, newspaper clippings about Voldemort that he had once collected with pride, now bearing a different significance. He instructed Kreacher to take him to the cave, making the house-elf promise that, whatever happened, he would return home afterward, destroy the original locket, and never tell the family what had transpired.

The journey to the cave carried a terrible finality Regulus must have felt with each step. The sharp pain as he cut his hand to grant entry, the eerie silence broken only by water dripping from stalactites, the ghostly green light reflecting off the lake's still surface. Upon reaching the island, Regulus replaced the locket with a fake, inside which he placed a note to Voldemort, signing it "R.A.B."—a final act of defiance revealing his true allegiance.

"To the Dark Lord,
I know I will be dead long before you read this
but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match,
you will be mortal once more.
R.A.B."

Then came the moment Regulus had prepared for—drinking the potion himself, experiencing the same torment he had condemned Kreacher to suffer. The house-elf watched in horror as his master consumed cup after cup, crying out from visions only he could see, begging for relief that could not come until the basin was empty.

Burning with thirst after consuming the potion, Regulus crawled to the edge of the island and reached for the water. The moment his fingers broke the surface, pale hands emerged—dozens, then hundreds of Inferi rising from the depths. They grasped his arms, his legs, his robes, dragging him inexorably into the black water.

As the dark surface closed over Regulus Black, aged only eighteen, he became something rare in the wizarding world—a Death Eater who chose redemption, who recognized his mistake and sacrificed everything to begin making amends. His body would remain with the Inferi, preserved in the cold depths, his fate unknown to his family, who merely recorded his death date on the family tapestry without explanation.

Kreacher returned to Grimmauld Place alone, devastated but bound by his promise. For years, he attempted to destroy the Horcrux as Regulus had ordered, not understanding that such dark magic could not be undone by conventional means. The locket remained intact, eventually stolen by the petty thief Mundungus Fletcher during the cleanup of the Black family home, then reclaimed and ultimately destroyed by Regulus's brother's godson, Harry Potter.

The tragedy of Regulus Black lies not only in his early death but in the silence that surrounded his sacrifice. For sixteen years, his final act of courage remained unknown, his memory tainted by the assumption that he had died a loyal Death Eater. Only when Kreacher finally revealed the truth to Harry Potter did Regulus receive recognition for his defiance of Voldemort.

Perhaps the most poignant aspect of Regulus's story is how it contrasts with his brother's. Sirius, the rebel who rejected his family's values from the beginning, followed the expected path to righteousness. Regulus, the perfect son who embraced those same values, found his way to a similar end through a much darker and more solitary journey. Their methods differed, but both brothers ultimately stood against the darkness that threatened their world.

As the ripples fade from the surface of that underground lake in our mind's eye, we're left to contemplate the quiet heroism of Regulus Black, whose journey from darkness to light reminds us that redemption often comes not in grand gestures witnessed by many, but in private moments of moral clarity, acted upon despite the certainty of personal cost.

What hidden acts of courage lie beneath the surface of lives we think we understand, and how might we honor those whose redemption stories remain untold?
