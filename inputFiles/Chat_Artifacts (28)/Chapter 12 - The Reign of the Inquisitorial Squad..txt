Chapter 12: The Reign of the Inquisitorial Squad.

Power, once granted, reveals character far more effectively than any truth serum. In the long and storied history of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, few episodes better illustrate this principle than the brief but notorious reign of the Inquisitorial Squad—a select group of students elevated to unprecedented authority during Dolores Umbridge's tenure as Headmistress. As our final tale unfolds this evening, let us examine how a school discipline system was transformed into an instrument of control, and what this transformation revealed about those who wielded its power.

Imagine walking through Hogwarts during the spring of 1996. The corridors that once buzzed with casual conversation now echo with hushed whispers that fall silent when footsteps approach. Students travel in groups, eyes watchful for the gleam of small silver badges shaped like the letter "I"—the insignia that marked members of the Inquisitorial Squad and granted them authority beyond that of ordinary prefects.

The formation of the Inquisitorial Squad represented a significant departure from Hogwarts' traditional disciplinary structure. For centuries, the school had operated with a system of House prefects selected from fifth and seventh-year students, complemented by the Head Boy and Head Girl. These positions carried certain privileges and responsibilities, including the ability to dock house points for minor infractions and to refer more serious matters to Heads of Houses or the Headmaster.

This system, while not without flaws, maintained several important checks on authority. Prefects could only remove points from their own house in exceptional circumstances, creating a natural disincentive against excessive punishment. Their authority derived from the collective Hogwarts staff rather than individual professors, preventing any single teacher from creating a personal enforcement group. And perhaps most importantly, prefects were selected based on demonstrated character and responsibility rather than alignment with particular ideologies.

The Inquisitorial Squad dismantled these safeguards entirely. Created through Educational Decree Number Twenty-eight, the Squad operated under the direct authority of Umbridge herself, bypassing traditional channels of school governance. Its members could dock points from prefects, remove substantially larger numbers of points than prefects were permitted to, and report directly to the Headmistress without consulting Heads of Houses. This concentration of power effectively created a parallel disciplinary system answerable only to Umbridge and, by extension, to the Ministry of Magic.

Membership in the Inquisitorial Squad was not determined by demonstrated leadership qualities or academic achievement but by willingness to support Umbridge's agenda and Ministry policies. In practice, this selection criterion resulted in recruitment exclusively from Slytherin House, exacerbating existing house rivalries and creating a perception that institutional power had been captured by a single faction within the school.

The founding members included students like Draco Malfoy, already a prefect whose father held significant influence at the Ministry; Pansy Parkinson, whose enthusiasm for enforcing rules against personal enemies often exceeded her interest in consistent application of regulations; and larger students like Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, whose physical presence added an implicit threat of intimidation to Squad activities.

Daily life under the Inquisitorial Squad's oversight took on aspects of surveillance culture more reminiscent of authoritarian states than educational institutions. Squad members patrolled corridors in pairs, often positioning themselves near gathering places like the Great Hall entrance or library to monitor conversations. Students developed code words and signals to warn friends when Squad members approached, and previously public spaces like courtyards became less frequented as students sought areas beyond easy observation.

The Squad's approach to enforcement revealed much about both the individuals involved and the system that empowered them. Points were deducted with unprecedented inconsistency and often for infractions invented on the spot. Gryffindor students might lose points for "looking too happy" or "breathing loudly," while identical behaviors from Slytherin students went unremarked. The traditional house point system, designed to encourage positive behavior and house pride, devolved into an instrument of arbitrary punishment disconnected from any meaningful standard of conduct.

This capricious enforcement created a climate where students became hesitant to express opinions or participate fully in school life. Classroom discussions grew more restrained, particularly in subjects like History of Magic or Defense Against the Dark Arts, where contemporary events might naturally arise as topics. Extracurricular activities diminished as students sought to minimize visibility, and casual inter-house friendships became more difficult to maintain under the watchful eyes of Squad members looking for rule violations.

Perhaps most insidious was the Squad's role in monitoring and reporting private conversations. Members would position themselves near groups of students, listening for any criticism of Umbridge or the Ministry and assigning punishments for "disloyalty" or "spreading lies." This practice effectively criminalized political discussion among students, treating disagreement with official positions as a disciplinary issue rather than a normal part of educational development.

The psychological impact on the student body manifested in various ways. Many students, particularly younger ones, developed anxiety around everyday activities, constantly checking for Squad members before speaking freely. Others adopted a facade of excessive rule-following and pro-Ministry sentiment when in public spaces. The most resistant formed underground communication networks, using enchanted coins or coded messages to maintain contact while avoiding detection.

For the Squad members themselves, the experience of wielding such unchecked authority had observable effects on behavior and character. Some, like Draco Malfoy, displayed increasing comfort with exercising power over others, graduating from verbal taunts to actual punishment with apparent satisfaction. The ability to dock significant house points provided certain members with a means to settle personal grudges under the guise of official duty. The lack of accountability for their actions fostered an environment where power became increasingly divorced from responsibility.

Not all students offered the opportunity joined the Squad, however. Some Slytherin prefects reportedly declined membership, though they generally kept their reasons private to avoid becoming targets themselves. These quiet refusals represented an important counterpoint to the narrative that house affiliation alone determined ethical choices during this period.

The high-water mark of the Inquisitorial Squad's influence came during their discovery of Dumbledore's Army, the secret defense group organized by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. Acting on information from Marietta Edgecombe, Squad members participated in raiding the Room of Requirement and capturing several DA members, including Harry Potter. Their cooperation with Umbridge in this action demonstrated how thoroughly they had embraced their role as enforcers of Ministry policy rather than upholders of traditional school values.

The aftermath of this raid illustrated both the extent and limits of the Squad's power. While they successfully exposed the forbidden organization and created the circumstances that led to Dumbledore's temporary removal from the school, they proved incapable of locating or capturing most DA members. More significantly, their actions generated increased resentment among the student body, solidifying opposition to Umbridge's regime rather than suppressing it.

As spring progressed toward summer, tensions continued to escalate. Squad members grew bolder in their enforcement, sometimes operating in larger groups that resembled patrols more than prefect rounds. Incidents of confrontation between Squad members and other students increased, though outright magical dueling remained rare due to the severe consequences threatened by Umbridge for such resistance.

The system collapsed dramatically during the final days of Umbridge's headship. When Fred and George Weasley orchestrated their legendary departure from Hogwarts—turning a corridor into a swamp and setting off massive amounts of magical fireworks—the Inquisitorial Squad proved entirely ineffective at maintaining order. Their authority, based entirely on Umbridge's backing rather than genuine respect from the student body, evaporated in the face of widespread celebration of the twins' rebellion.

The subsequent chaos demonstrated how thoroughly the traditional values of the school had rejected the imposed authority structure. Peeves the poltergeist, normally a indiscriminate troublemaker, focused his efforts on tormenting Umbridge and, by extension, her Squad. Teachers who had previously remained outwardly compliant with Umbridge's directives found creative ways to avoid assisting with discipline, leaving Squad members increasingly isolated as the only defenders of a crumbling system.

The final humiliation for the Inquisitorial Squad came when several members, including Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Warrington, attempted to ambush Harry Potter and Hermione Granger outside Umbridge's office. The confrontation ended with Squad members subjected to various hexes and jinxes that left them temporarily incapacitated and, in some cases, physically transformed. This defeat, witnessed by many students, permanently shattered the aura of authority the Squad had attempted to project.

After Umbridge's removal following the fiasco at the Department of Mysteries, the Inquisitorial Squad was immediately disbanded by the returning school authorities. The silver "I" badges disappeared overnight, and the traditional prefect system was reinstated. However, the social consequences for former Squad members lingered through the remainder of the term and into the following year.

Many faced ostracism from peers outside their immediate circle, viewed as collaborators with an illegitimate authority. Some reportedly expressed regret about their participation, claiming they had merely been following school rules, though such justifications received little sympathy from students who had suffered under their enforcement. The experience provided an early lesson in how association with authoritarian systems can carry lasting social consequences even after those systems collapse.

From a historical perspective, the Inquisitorial Squad represents an important case study in how educational institutions can be subverted for political purposes. By creating a parallel disciplinary structure outside traditional governance, embedding ideological loyalty as a selection criterion, and granting exceptional powers without proportional oversight, Umbridge effectively transformed student against student, weaponizing peer relationships to enforce compliance with external authority.

The episode also demonstrates how institutional cultures resist such impositions. Despite the Squad's formal authority, they never achieved the legitimate leadership role that traditional prefects held in the school community. Their power remained externally imposed rather than internally accepted, making it ultimately unsustainable when its ministerial backing collapsed.

For the students who lived through this period, the experience offered sobering lessons about power, resistance, and moral choice that would prove relevant during the darker days of Voldemort's return. Those who witnessed the Inquisitorial Squad's reign—both its members and those subjected to their authority—would soon face more consequential decisions about collaboration or resistance under the Death Eater regime that followed.

As we conclude our exploration of this troubled chapter in Hogwarts history, the embers in our hearth burning low and shadows deepening in the corners, consider what the Inquisitorial Squad reveals about authority and its exercise. When offered power beyond the normal constraints of your position, with the freedom to apply rules selectively against those you dislike, what choices would you make? And when facing such authority yourself, what courage would you find to maintain your integrity in the face of punishment?
