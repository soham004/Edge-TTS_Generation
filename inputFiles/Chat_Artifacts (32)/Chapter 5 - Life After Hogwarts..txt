Chapter 5: Life After Hogwarts.

The road stretches before us, winding away from the towering spires of Hogwarts and into the mist-shrouded wilderness beyond. Tonight, we follow the path that Salazar Slytherin himself once walked, departing from the school he helped create, carrying with him a heart heavy with disappointment yet still burning with magical purpose. What becomes of a founder who leaves his own foundation? Where does a wizard of such profound ability and ambition turn when his grandest vision splinters?

Imagine Slytherin on that fateful morning of his departure—a tall figure silhouetted against the dawn light, perhaps pausing at the edge of the lake to cast one final glance at the castle rising from the Scottish highlands. Did he feel regret in that moment? Or was his resolve only strengthened by the sight of what he was leaving behind? Historical records offer us only fragments, but the tapestry of subsequent events allows us to piece together the remarkable second chapter of Slytherin's life.

Most magical historians believe that upon leaving Hogwarts, Salazar Slytherin initially traveled southward, returning to the fens of East Anglia where he had spent his youth. The marshy landscapes of this region, with their shifting boundaries between land and water, had always resonated with his nature. Contemporary accounts place him in isolated settlements across the fens during the year following his departure from Hogwarts, a solitary figure whose presence was noted but rarely welcomed.

Slytherin's ancestral home still stood in these wetlands—a sprawling stone structure half-hidden by enchantments, rising from a small island of solid ground amidst the surrounding marshes. Magical genealogists believe the house had passed to distant relatives during Slytherin's long absence at Hogwarts, but his return would have commanded respect, if not necessarily warmth. Imagine him reclaiming chambers within this ancient dwelling, rooms where the air hung heavy with memories of his childhood learning and early magical experiments.

It was here, in the solitude of his ancestral lands, that Slytherin is believed to have begun the work that would occupy the remainder of his life—the creation of a different kind of magical legacy. If Hogwarts would not be shaped according to his vision, he would channel his considerable talents into other forms of magical achievement. The marshy isolation provided perfect secrecy for experimentation with magic that even his fellow founders might have considered questionable.

Foremost among Slytherin's post-Hogwarts pursuits was the refinement of Parseltongue magic. While his ability to speak with serpents was innate, historical records suggest he developed an entire branch of spellwork that could only be performed by Parselmouths. Ancient texts preserved in private collections describe protective enchantments, healing spells, and divination methods that required serpent language for their activation. Through this work, Slytherin ensured that certain magical knowledge would remain exclusively available to his descendants who inherited his rare linguistic gift.

Alongside this specialized magic, Slytherin turned his attention to the creation of magical artifacts. The silver locket set with emeralds that became his most famous possession likely dates from this period. Contemporary accounts describe it as more than merely decorative—it reportedly contained protective enchantments of extraordinary sophistication, capable of warning its wearer of approaching enemies and neutralizing certain poisons. Some magical historians believe the locket also served as a repository for magical knowledge, perhaps containing memories or spells that Slytherin wished to preserve for future generations.

The isolation of the fens suited Slytherin's increasingly secretive nature, but it could not satisfy his ambition indefinitely. Historical records place him traveling extensively during the middle years of his life after Hogwarts, journeying to magical communities across Europe and possibly beyond. A reference in the private journals of an 11th-century Byzantine wizard mentions "the serpent-speaker from the northern isles whose knowledge of water-binding surpasses all masters of Constantinople." Similar accounts from magical communities in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa suggest Slytherin's reputation—and influence—spread widely during these wandering years.

What was he seeking in these travels? Some magical historians believe he was gathering knowledge absent from Britain's magical traditions, particularly in the areas of protective enchantments and magical bloodline preservation. Others suggest he was actively recruiting like-minded wizards and witches who shared his concerns about Muggle-magical relations, perhaps establishing a network that would eventually evolve into the pure-blood supremacist movements of later centuries. The truth likely encompasses elements of both theories—Slytherin's intellectual curiosity remained powerful, even as his social and political convictions hardened.

During these travels, Slytherin is believed to have fathered at least one child, establishing the bloodline that would eventually lead to the Gaunt family and, many centuries later, to Tom Riddle. Historical records are unclear about the identity of this child's mother, though magical genealogists have proposed several candidates from prominent European wizarding families. What is certain is that Slytherin took unusual measures to ensure his magical abilities—particularly Parseltongue—would persist through generations, employing blood magic that bound these traits to his descendants.

The wandering years eventually gave way to a final period of settlement. Most magical historians place Slytherin's later life in a remote valley in Albania, a region with ancient magical traditions and minimal Muggle presence. Here, among dense forests and mist-shrouded mountains, he established what might be considered a smaller, more exclusive version of the school he had envisioned. A handful of students—all from wizarding families, many reportedly distant relatives—came to study under his direct tutelage.

Imagine this Albanian sanctuary: a stone dwelling built into the side of a mountain, its walls carved with serpentine patterns that seemed to move in the flickering torchlight. Inside, chambers dedicated to different magical disciplines—a potions laboratory with ingredients rarer than those found at Hogwarts; a dueling space where Slytherin trained his students in combat magic; a library containing texts on magical theory too controversial for the Hogwarts collection. Outside, gardens of magical plants climbed the mountainside, tended by serpents that responded to Parseltongue commands.

This was no formal institution like Hogwarts, with its houses and structured curriculum, but rather an apprenticeship model where students learned directly from the master. Historical accounts suggest Slytherin's teaching methods grew increasingly demanding in these later years, his patience diminished by his experiences. Those who failed to meet his expectations were dismissed without ceremony; those who excelled became the carriers of magical knowledge that would eventually develop into what some magical historians identify as a distinct "Slytherin tradition" within European wizardry.

It was during this Albanian period that Slytherin made his final and perhaps most controversial magical innovations. Fragmentary records suggest experimentation with forms of magical preservation that approached, if never quite crossed into, the realm of immortality. While there is no evidence that Slytherin created Horcruxes—that terrible innovation would wait for other, darker wizards—his research into extending life and preserving magical essence influenced generations of magical scholars, not all of whom used this knowledge for benevolent purposes.

As age began to claim even his formidable constitution, Slytherin turned his attention to ensuring his legacy would endure. Beyond the Chamber of Secrets hidden at Hogwarts, he created other repositories of magical knowledge throughout Europe. Some were physical locations—caves, ruins, or seemingly abandoned dwellings that contained hidden chambers accessible only to those with Parseltongue or knowledge of specific magical signatures. Others were artifacts—books whose true contents revealed themselves only to those of his bloodline, or objects that contained preserved memories similar to those later stored in Pensieves.

The exact date and circumstances of Salazar Slytherin's death remain unknown. No grave has ever been identified, leading some magical historians to speculate that he employed enchantments to conceal his final resting place, perhaps fearing that enemies might seek to desecrate it or that unworthy wizards might attempt to claim artifacts buried with him. What seems certain is that his passing was solitary—far from Hogwarts and the other founders who had once been his closest colleagues.

In the years following his death, Slytherin's reputation underwent the first of many transformations. To his direct students and their descendants, he remained a visionary whose wisdom had preserved important magical traditions. To the wider wizarding world, particularly those influenced by the remaining Hogwarts founders, he increasingly became a cautionary figure whose prejudices had deprived him of a place in the school's continuing success. Both perspectives contained elements of truth, yet neither captured the full complexity of the man.

Perhaps the most telling aspect of Slytherin's post-Hogwarts life was the duality of his legacy. While his name remained permanently associated with the Hogwarts house that trained generations of witches and wizards, his direct magical lineage followed a separate, more secretive path through history. This division—between the public institution that bears his name and the private knowledge passed through his bloodline—reflects the fundamental tension that defined his life: the desire to preserve magical tradition set against the need to adapt to a changing world.

The fire has burned low now, casting gentle shadows across our chamber. As the cinders glow against the darkened hearth, consider how even endings can contain beginnings. Slytherin's departure from Hogwarts closed one chapter of his remarkable life but opened another filled with different achievements and influences. His story reminds us that a single path abandoned does not determine the entirety of one's journey.

As sleep draws nearer, ponder this: How do we reshape our ambitions when our original vision cannot be realized? And what separate peace might we find, like Slytherin in his Albanian retreat, when we build something smaller but entirely our own from the fragments of grander dreams?
