Chapter 10: Salazar's Legacy in the Wizarding Wars.

Ideas cast long shadows through time, their influence extending far beyond the lives of those who first conceived them. As our nighttime journey continues, let us examine how the legacy of Salazar Slytherin—his beliefs, his symbols, and his bloodline—shaped the two great conflicts that nearly destroyed the wizarding world in the twentieth century. For in both the First and Second Wizarding Wars, echoes of Slytherin's thousand-year-old philosophy reverberated through the motivations and methods of those who sought to remake magical society in their image.

The seeds of these conflicts were planted centuries before, in the fundamental disagreement between Salazar Slytherin and the other Hogwarts founders regarding who should receive magical education. Slytherin's concern about admitting Muggle-born students—whether motivated by security fears, cultural preservation, or prejudice—evolved over generations into the doctrine of blood purity that would eventually fuel Lord Voldemort's rise to power. This transformation represents one of history's most profound examples of how founding principles can be distorted and radicalized over time.

By the early twentieth century, certain factions within wizarding Britain had developed an ideology that bore only superficial resemblance to Slytherin's original position. Where he had advocated caution regarding Muggle-magical relations during a time of genuine persecution, these groups promoted active subjugation of Muggles and Muggle-borns in an era of relative peace. Where Slytherin had valued magical ability and ambition regardless of its source (even while preferring pure-blood students), these factions defined worth exclusively through bloodline, dismissing magical talent when it appeared in those they deemed "impure."

This radicalized version of Slytherin's philosophy found its most charismatic champion in Tom Riddle, whose complex relationship with his ancestor's legacy merits careful examination. Despite being half-blood himself—son of a witch mother and Muggle father—Riddle embraced and amplified the most extreme interpretations of Slytherin's beliefs. This apparent contradiction reveals much about both Riddle's psychology and the malleability of historical legacies when wielded for political purposes.

As a student at Hogwarts during the 1940s, Riddle discovered his connection to Salazar Slytherin with a mixture of pride and calculated opportunity. Imagine him in the Hogwarts library, poring over ancient genealogies by wandlight, tracing the connections between the Gaunts and Slytherin himself. For a brilliantly talented orphan who had grown up believing himself unwanted and ordinary, this discovery provided both identity and purpose—a glorious heritage that set him apart from his peers.

Yet Riddle's embrace of Slytherin's legacy was selective from the beginning. Historical accounts suggest he quickly associated himself with the founder's more controversial aspects while showing little interest in Slytherin's genuine magical innovations or educational philosophy. The Chamber of Secrets, designed by Slytherin as what he considered a necessary safeguard for the school, became in Riddle's hands merely a weapon to terrorize Muggle-born students and frame another student for murder.

As Riddle transformed himself into Lord Voldemort during the years following his graduation from Hogwarts, he increasingly wrapped his political movement in the symbolism of Salazar Slytherin. The serpent, once merely Slytherin's personal emblem reflecting his Parseltongue abilities, became the Dark Mark—branded on followers' arms and cast into the sky over scenes of murder and destruction. Slytherin's house colors of green and silver became associated with Voldemort's cause, creating an unfair but powerful connection in the public mind between current Slytherin students and Death Eater activities.

The First Wizarding War, which began in the 1970s, saw Voldemort explicitly invoke Slytherin's name and legacy to justify his campaign of terror. "Salazar Slytherin's noble work," he reportedly told his followers, "will finally be completed." This rhetoric proved particularly effective in recruiting from certain pure-blood families with historical connections to Slytherin House, who found in Voldemort's movement validation for long-held beliefs about their inherent superiority.

Yet the Dark Lord's interpretation of Slytherin's "noble work" bore little resemblance to the founder's actual goals. Where Slytherin had sought to protect the magical community through caution and security measures, Voldemort pursued power through division and destruction. Where Slytherin had valued cunning and resourcefulness as means to achievement, Voldemort employed these traits primarily in service of cruelty and domination. The sophisticated magical innovations of the founder had devolved, in his self-proclaimed heir, into crude displays of power designed primarily to inspire fear.

This distortion extended to Voldemort's treatment of Slytherin's actual physical legacy. The locket, designed as a repository of knowledge and protection, became a vessel for a fragment of his shattered soul. The Chamber of Secrets, intended as a final defensive measure, was repurposed as an offensive weapon. Even Parseltongue, which Slytherin had developed into a sophisticated magical discipline, was reduced by Voldemort to a means of controlling deadly creatures and communicating secretly with followers.

The First Wizarding War claimed countless victims—magical and Muggle alike—but perhaps its most significant casualty was historical truth itself. As Voldemort's campaign intensified, public perception of Salazar Slytherin deteriorated further, with many in the wizarding community coming to view him solely as the ideological forefather of a terrorist movement. This simplification erased the complexity of Slytherin's actual historical position and the many positive contributions he had made to magical knowledge and education.

The temporary defeat of Voldemort in 1981, through his failed attack on infant Harry Potter, brought an uneasy peace but did little to rehabilitate Slytherin's reputation. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Slytherin House at Hogwarts continued to bear the stigma of its association with the Dark Lord, with many parents expressing concern if their children were sorted into the house of serpents. This period also saw the emergence of simplified historical narratives that portrayed Slytherin as unambiguously villainous, rather than as the complex and contradictory figure revealed by more nuanced historical study.

When Voldemort returned to physical form in 1995, initiating the Second Wizarding War, he once again invoked Slytherin's legacy—now with even greater emphasis on his personal status as the founder's heir and last descendant. This claim to hereditary authority proved particularly effective in bringing certain wavering pure-blood families into his camp, as they saw alignment with Slytherin's "true heir" as both politically advantageous and ideologically consistent with their family traditions.

The Second Wizarding War saw Voldemort achieve what had eluded him during the first conflict: effective control of key wizarding institutions. When the Ministry of Magic fell to Death Eater infiltration in 1997, elements of Voldemort's distorted version of Slytherin's philosophy became official policy. The Muggle-Born Registration Commission, headed by Dolores Umbridge (herself not a Death Eater but an opportunistic bureaucrat), implemented a system requiring magical individuals to prove their "blood status"—an approach that would have horrified the real Salazar Slytherin, whose concern was magical security rather than bureaucratic persecution.

At Hogwarts itself, with Death Eaters Alecto and Amycus Carrow installed as teachers under Headmaster Severus Snape's complicated leadership, students were taught a version of magical history that elevated Slytherin to near-divine status while denigrating the other founders. Young witches and wizards were instructed that Slytherin's desire to restrict magical education to pure-bloods was not merely correct but self-evident—a "natural law" rather than one perspective among many. This propaganda campaign represented perhaps the most extreme distortion of Slytherin's legacy, reducing a sophisticated magical thinker to a one-dimensional symbol of blood purism.

Throughout this period, however, resistance to this appropriation of Slytherin's legacy emerged from unlikely quarters. Some members of Slytherin House itself, particularly those from less radical pure-blood families or half-blood backgrounds, quietly opposed the Death Eater regime while maintaining outward compliance for survival. Historical accounts mention Slytherin prefects who used their authority to shield younger students from the worst of the Carrows' abuses, and at least a few Slytherin students who passed information to Dumbledore's Army despite the personal risk.

More significantly, Severus Snape—Head of Slytherin House and double agent serving Dumbledore while posing as Voldemort's loyal supporter—embodied an alternative interpretation of Slytherin values. His cunning was employed not for personal gain but for long-term strategic resistance; his ambition channeled not toward power but toward redemption; his resourcefulness dedicated to protecting students even while maintaining his cover. Though few knew it at the time, Snape represented Slytherin qualities directed toward ultimately noble ends, offering a counterpoint to Voldemort's corruption of those same traits.

The climactic Battle of Hogwarts in May 1998 brought these competing visions of Slytherin's legacy into direct conflict. When Minerva McGonagall ordered Slytherin students evacuated before the battle—a precautionary measure given uncertain loyalties—it seemed the house's association with Voldemort's cause had become total. Yet as the conflict progressed, a more complex picture emerged. While some adult Slytherin alumni fought alongside the Death Eaters, others returned with reinforcements to defend the school, suggesting that even within the house most associated with Voldemort, allegiances remained individual rather than collective.

Voldemort himself made his headquarters during the battle in the Shrieking Shack rather than the Chamber of Secrets or Slytherin's dungeons—a telling choice that reflected his increasingly tenuous connection to the founder he claimed as ancestor. By this point, his invocation of Slytherin's name had become largely perfunctory, a rhetorical device rather than a genuine philosophical position. The Dark Lord's final confrontation with Harry Potter in the Great Hall—where he fell to his own rebounding curse—contained no reference to Slytherin at all, suggesting that even Voldemort had ultimately moved beyond needing this historical justification for his actions.

In the years following Voldemort's defeat, the wizarding world began a careful reassessment of Salazar Slytherin's actual legacy, distinct from the distortions imposed by the Dark Lord's movement. Magical historians published more nuanced accounts of the founder's life and beliefs, acknowledging both his genuine concerns about magical security and the ways these concerns had been magnified and twisted over centuries. Hogwarts itself, under the leadership of Minerva McGonagall, implemented educational reforms that presented a more balanced view of all four founders, including Slytherin's positive contributions to magical education.

Perhaps most significantly, Harry Potter—who had defeated Voldemort and ended the Second Wizarding War—spoke publicly about the complexity of Slytherin's legacy. Having himself been nearly sorted into Slytherin as a student, having temporarily possessed Parseltongue ability through his connection to Voldemort, and having witnessed Severus Snape's ultimate loyalty to Dumbledore despite his Slytherin background, Potter was uniquely positioned to advocate for a more nuanced understanding of the house and its founder.

"The qualities Salazar Slytherin valued—ambition, resourcefulness, determination—are not inherently dark," Potter reportedly told students during a guest lecture at Hogwarts some years after the war. "Like any traits, they can be directed toward creative or destructive ends. Voldemort chose to corrupt these qualities, but that was his choice, not Slytherin's intention. Judge people by their own actions, not by the house they were sorted into."

This perspective gained traction in post-war wizarding society, helping to rehabilitate Slytherin House's reputation and allowing its current students to escape the shadow of Voldemort's misappropriation. While certain extremist groups continued to invoke distorted versions of Slytherin's philosophy, mainstream magical opinion increasingly recognized the difference between the historical founder and the political movement that had claimed his mantle.

The long-term impact of the Wizarding Wars on Slytherin's legacy remains complex. On one hand, the conflicts created lasting associations between Slytherin's name and dark magic that may never fully dissipate. On the other, the post-war period has allowed for a more historically accurate reassessment of his life and contributions, potentially leading to a more balanced understanding for future generations of witches and wizards.

What remains certain is that Salazar Slytherin—a man who lived and died a thousand years before Voldemort's rise—could never have anticipated how his beliefs and symbols would be weaponized in conflicts far removed from his own time. The transformation of his legacy from educational philosophy to wartime propaganda offers a sobering reminder of how historical figures can be reimagined to serve contemporary purposes, their complexity flattened into simplistic narratives that bear little resemblance to historical truth.

As our candle burns low and the hour grows late, the shadows seem to shift with the weight of this complex history. The emblem of the serpent—once merely a reflection of Slytherin's rare magical gift, later a symbol of terror, now gradually returning to its original meaning—reminds us how powerful symbols persist while their interpretations evolve across centuries.

Before sleep claims you, consider this: What ideas of our own age might be similarly transformed by future generations, twisted to purposes we never intended? And how might we ensure that the truest elements of our own legacies—the wisdom rather than the prejudices, the creativity rather than the fears—are what endure when we, like Salazar Slytherin, exist only in history and memory?
