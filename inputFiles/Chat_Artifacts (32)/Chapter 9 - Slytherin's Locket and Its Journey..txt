Chapter 9: Slytherin's Locket and Its Journey.

Objects of power carry stories within their metal and stone, absorbing the essence of those who possess them through the years. As the midnight hour approaches and shadows deepen around us, let us trace the remarkable journey of perhaps the most significant artifact associated with Salazar Slytherin—his famous locket. This gleaming silver pendant, inlaid with glittering emeralds in the form of a serpentine S, traveled a path from honored heirloom to corrupted vessel, its thousand-year history mirroring the complex legacy of its creator.

The creation of the locket dates to Slytherin's time at Hogwarts, though whether it was forged before or after the founding of the school remains a subject of scholarly debate. Crafted of goblin-wrought silver—a material known for its exceptional magical conductivity and resistance to tarnishing—the locket showcased both Slytherin's appreciation for fine craftsmanship and his practical approach to magical objects. This was no mere ornament, but a sophisticated magical tool disguised as a piece of jewelry.

The locket's original enchantments reflected Slytherin's preoccupation with protection and knowledge preservation. Historical accounts suggest it contained expanded space within—an early application of extension charms—where Slytherin stored important magical knowledge in the form of miniaturized scrolls and memory strands that could be accessed by the wearer. Additionally, the locket could reportedly warm against the skin when danger approached and offer limited protection against certain curses and poisons—functions that made it a formidable protective talisman as well as a repository of wisdom.

The serpentine "S" inlaid in emeralds served multiple purposes beyond simply representing Slytherin's initial. The tiny emeralds were reportedly enchanted to absorb ambient magic from the environment, slowly charging the locket's protective capabilities over time. The serpentine shape facilitated the flow of this magical energy throughout the piece, creating a self-sustaining enchantment that allowed the locket to maintain its powers indefinitely without requiring recharging by the wearer.

During Slytherin's lifetime, the locket rarely left his person. Contemporary accounts describe him wearing it for all significant magical workings and ceremonial occasions at Hogwarts. When he departed the school after his falling out with the other founders, the locket went with him—one of the few physical connections that remained between Slytherin and the institution he had helped create.

After Slytherin's death, the locket passed to his direct descendants, becoming the most prized heirloom of his bloodline. For several generations, it was worn by the head of the family as a symbol of their lineage and magical authority. Imagine these early inheritors—powerful witches and wizards still close enough to Slytherin's time to remember him as an ancestor rather than a legendary figure—drawing on the locket's stored knowledge and protective enchantments as they navigated the increasingly complex political landscape of medieval wizarding Britain.

The locket's journey through the centuries mirrored the gradual decline of the Slytherin bloodline itself. As the family's fortunes waned and its members grew increasingly isolated, the locket took on heightened significance—a tangible reminder of their illustrious ancestry even as other markers of status slipped away. Historical records suggest that during periods of particular hardship, family members would sometimes attempt to sell other valuables before parting with the locket, so central was it to their identity.

By the 16th century, as the main branch of Slytherin's descendants adopted the surname Gaunt, the locket had become not merely an heirloom but the centerpiece of family mythology. Stories passed down through generations claimed that wearing the locket granted special insight into the thoughts of others, or that it could reveal hidden magical talent in the wearer. While magical historians consider most of these claims exaggerations or misinterpretations of the locket's actual enchantments, they demonstrate the almost religious significance the object had acquired within the increasingly insular Gaunt family.

As the Gaunts' circumstances deteriorated further, the physical condition of the locket began to suffer as well. Although goblin-wrought silver resists normal tarnishing, extended exposure to powerful magic can cause such metals to develop a distinctive patina. The locket, worn by generations of magical practitioners and sometimes used in increasingly desperate attempts to restore family fortunes through questionable magical workings, gradually developed a darkened surface that obscured some of its original luster.

The most dramatic chapter in the locket's pre-modern history came during the lifetime of Corvinus Gaunt in the 18th century. Historical accounts suggest that Corvinus, facing financial ruin, briefly pawned the locket to a wizard moneylender in Knockturn Alley to secure funds for an investment opportunity. When the investment failed, Corvinus reportedly recovered the locket through dubious means, possibly including memory charms to make the moneylender forget the transaction. This incident marked the first time the locket had left family possession, however briefly, in its long history.

By the early 20th century, the locket had come into the possession of Marvolo Gaunt, who by that point lived in squalid conditions in a small cottage near Little Hangleton. Despite the family's reduced circumstances, Marvolo's pride in his ancestry remained intact, and he frequently displayed the locket as proof of his connection to Salazar Slytherin. Imagine the tarnished pendant hanging in that dim cottage, its emeralds catching what little light filtered through grimy windows, a remnant of greatness amid decay.

When Ministry officials visited the Gaunt cottage in connection with Morfin Gaunt's attack on a local Muggle, Marvolo brandished the locket at them, proclaiming it proof of his superior lineage. The irony of this moment—a once-powerful magical artifact reduced to a prop in a squalid confrontation—reflects the broader tragedy of the Gaunt family's decline. The locket, designed by Slytherin as a sophisticated magical tool, had become merely a symbol, its actual enchantments largely forgotten or dormant from neglect.

The locket's journey took its most consequential turn when Merope Gaunt, Marvolo's daughter, fled her abusive home after her father and brother were imprisoned for attacking Ministry officials. Taking the locket—perhaps the only item of value accessible to her—Merope escaped to London, where her desperate circumstances eventually led her to sell the family heirloom to Caractacus Burke, co-founder of Borgin and Burkes in Knockturn Alley.

Burke, recognizing the locket's historical significance despite its tarnished condition, reportedly paid Merope only ten Galleons for the priceless artifact—a pittance that reflected both his unscrupulous business practices and Merope's desperate ignorance of the object's true value. The pregnant and destitute young woman used these meager funds to briefly sustain herself before eventually dying in childbirth at a Muggle orphanage, where her son, Tom Marvolo Riddle, was born.

For years, the locket remained in the inventory at Borgin and Burkes, displayed as a curiosity with a hefty price tag that kept it from being sold. Burke would occasionally show it to interested collectors, boasting of how he had acquired it from a ragged young woman who had no idea of its worth. The locket's enchantments, dormant from years of neglect and separation from the bloodline it was designed to serve, gave no outward sign of the powerful magic still contained within its silver casing.

It was in this shop that the locket's path crossed once more with that of Slytherin's bloodline, though in a form neither Salazar nor generations of Gaunts could have anticipated. Tom Riddle, now a handsome young man who had discovered his heritage during his time at Hogwarts, took a position at Borgin and Burkes after graduating—a position far beneath his magical abilities but one that gave him access to artifacts of dark historical significance.

Riddle would have seen the locket during his employment at the shop, perhaps even handling it as part of his duties. Imagine him holding this tarnished piece of silver, connecting physically for the first time with the ancestral legacy he had only recently discovered. Did the locket, designed to respond to Slytherin's bloodline, stir in some subtle way when touched by this distant descendant? Historical accounts offer no answer, but the encounter set in motion events that would transform both Riddle and the locket itself.

The locket eventually left Borgin and Burkes through another transaction colored by manipulation and tragedy. Hepzibah Smith, a wealthy elderly witch with a passion for collecting historical artifacts, purchased it along with another founder's relic—Hufflepuff's cup—adding them to her extensive collection. Smith, delighted with these prestigious acquisitions, enjoyed showing them to visitors as proof of her discerning taste and financial means.

One such visitor was Tom Riddle himself, who called upon Smith in his capacity as a Borgin and Burkes employee ostensibly interested in acquiring some of her goblin-made armor for the shop. Smith, flattered by the handsome young man's attention, showed him her most prized possessions, including Slytherin's locket—unaware that she was showing the heir of Slytherin an artifact he considered rightfully his by blood.

What followed was perhaps the darkest moment in the locket's long history. Riddle, now pursuing the creation of Horcruxes to achieve immortality, murdered Hepzibah Smith, using her death to fragment his soul. He then stole both the locket and Hufflepuff's cup before modifying her house-elf's memories to take the blame for accidentally poisoning her mistress. The locket, created as a tool of protection and knowledge, had become associated with murder and the darkest of magical violations.

For years after this theft, the locket disappeared from historical record as Riddle—increasingly calling himself Lord Voldemort—traveled widely, delving deeper into dark magic. What is known with certainty is that during this period, he transformed the locket into a Horcrux, a vessel containing a fragment of his shattered soul. This profoundly unnatural magic corrupted the locket's original enchantments, twisting them toward preservation of the soul fragment rather than the protective and knowledge-storing functions Slytherin had designed.

When Voldemort eventually decided to hide his Horcruxes in locations of personal significance, he chose a remote seaside cave he had visited during his orphanage days for the locket. The cave, already possessing a foreboding atmosphere, was further enhanced with layers of dark enchantments—blood sacrifices required for entry, an underground lake populated by Inferi, and a basin filled with a potion that induced unbearable suffering in anyone who drank it. At the bottom of this basin, Voldemort placed the locket, now transformed from family heirloom to repository of fragmented soul.

The locket might have remained there indefinitely had it not been for the actions of another, unexpected figure in its complex history: Regulus Black. This young Death Eater, having discovered something of Voldemort's Horcrux plan and become disillusioned with the Dark Lord's methods, embarked on a daring mission to retrieve and destroy the locket. With the assistance of his house-elf, Kreacher, Regulus penetrated the cave's defenses, drank the torturous potion, and retrieved the locket, replacing it with a fake containing a defiant note to Voldemort.

This act of redemption cost Regulus his life, as he was dragged beneath the water by the Inferi while ensuring Kreacher's escape with the genuine locket. The house-elf, unable to destroy the Horcrux despite repeated attempts, kept it hidden in the Black family home at Grimmauld Place for years, honoring his master's final command even as he failed to complete the mission of destruction.

During the cleaning of Grimmauld Place in the summer of 1995, the locket was briefly handled by members of the Order of the Phoenix, who, unaware of its significance, classified it as worthless dark junk destined for disposal. It was at this point that Mundungus Fletcher, an unscrupulous member of the Order with a tendency toward theft, pillaged the locket along with other silver items from the house after Sirius Black's death.

Fletcher's theft led to yet another change of hands when he was caught selling stolen goods in Hogsmeade by Dolores Umbridge. The former Hogwarts High Inquisitor confiscated the locket as a bribe to let Fletcher go, attracted by its serpentine design that aligned with her own fascination with kitsch decorative items featuring cats and, occasionally, snakes. Umbridge, entirely unaware of the locket's historical significance or its status as a Horcrux, began wearing it as a personal accessory during her work at the Ministry of Magic.

The final chapter of the locket's journey began when Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley, on the run during the Second Wizarding War, identified Umbridge as the current possessor of the Horcrux. Their daring infiltration of the Ministry resulted in the locket changing hands once more, though this transfer brought its own complications. The dark magic of the Horcrux affected anyone who wore it, amplifying negative emotions and creating discord—a far cry from the protective functions Slytherin had originally designed.

For months, the three friends carried the locket, taking turns wearing it to share the burden of its negative influence as they searched for a means to destroy it. The locket, sensing the threat to its existence, attempted to prevent its destruction when Ron finally raised the Sword of Gryffindor against it, revealing a twisted version of Harry and Hermione that played on Ron's deepest insecurities. This final defense failed, however, and the sword—imbued with basilisk venom from Harry's second year at Hogwarts—cleaved the locket in two, releasing a screaming shadow of Voldemort's soul fragment before falling silent forever.

The physical remains of the locket after its destruction have never been officially accounted for in historical records. Some magical historians believe Harry Potter may have kept the damaged pieces as a reminder of the journey that led to Voldemort's defeat. Others suggest the remains were turned over to the Department of Mysteries for study of Horcrux magic. A few fringe theories propose that the goblin-wrought silver, even after such magical corruption and physical damage, might eventually repair itself—though most experts dismiss this as highly unlikely given the nature of the destruction.

What is certain is that the locket's long journey—from the neck of Salazar Slytherin to the depths of a hidden cave, from a house-elf's trembling hands to a corrupted Ministry official's outfit, from the tent of three desperate teenagers to its final destruction—encompasses much of the complexity of wizarding history itself. In its thousand-year existence, the locket witnessed the rise and fall of its creator's bloodline, the corruption of his legacy, and ultimately, the defeat of the dark wizard who claimed to be Slytherin's true heir.

The fire has burned to embers now, casting a gentle ruddy glow across our chamber. As your thoughts drift toward sleep, consider this: What objects in our own lives carry stories within them, absorbing the essence of those who have possessed them through the years? And how might these silent witnesses to our joys and sorrows, our triumphs and failures, one day tell stories about us that we ourselves never anticipated?
