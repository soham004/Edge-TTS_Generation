Chapter 6: The Slytherin Bloodline.

Blood carries more than life through its crimson channels—it bears history, memory, and magic. As moonlight streams through our window, we shall follow the winding river of Salazar Slytherin's descendants through the centuries, tracing how the potent magic of this extraordinary wizard flowed through generations, sometimes running strong and proud, other times nearly vanishing into hidden tributaries, but always persisting—a magical lineage that would ultimately shape the fate of the wizarding world.

The immediate descendants of Salazar Slytherin emerged from his later years in Albania, where historical records suggest he established a family with a witch of notable magical ability. While her identity remains obscured by time, magical genealogists believe she likely came from one of the ancient magical families of Eastern Europe. Their children—at least two sons and possibly a daughter, according to fragmentary records—inherited not only their father's magical talent but also, crucially, his ability to speak Parseltongue, that rare gift of serpent communication that would become the hallmark of Slytherin's true heirs.

These first-generation descendants initially remained in Albania, continuing the exclusive magical education their father had established. Imagine them in that mountain retreat, young witches and wizards with Slytherin's proud bearing, practicing spells in the chambers their father had carved from living rock. They were raised with an acute awareness of their exceptional heritage—the children of a founder of Hogwarts, bearers of rare magical gifts, and heirs to knowledge that existed nowhere else in the wizarding world.

By the early 12th century, however, the Slytherin descendants began to disperse across Europe. Some magical historians attribute this diaspora to growing tensions with local magical communities, who viewed their secretive practices with suspicion. Others suggest it was a deliberate strategy to extend the family's influence. Whatever the reason, branches of the Slytherin line established themselves in various regions—southern France, northern Spain, parts of Italy, and eventually, some returned to Britain.

The British branch of the family, which would prove most consequential to later wizarding history, settled initially in the same fen country that had been Slytherin's original home. Here, they constructed a dwelling that combined elements of their Albanian retreat with traditional British wizarding architecture—a manor house whose foundations extended deep into the marshy ground, with hidden chambers accessible only through Parseltongue passwords. Local magical communities regarded them with a mixture of reverence and wariness, acknowledging their ancient lineage while remaining cautious of their isolationist tendencies.

Through the medieval period, the British Slytherin line maintained significant influence in wizarding affairs, though they rarely sought public positions of authority. Instead, they operated as advisors, particularly in matters concerning magical security and relations with the increasingly organized Muggle kingdoms. Historical records from the 13th century mention a "Lady Serpens of the Fens" who counseled magical communities on protective enchantments during a period of heightened witch-hunting. The serpent imagery in this title strongly suggests Slytherin lineage.

The 14th century brought both prominence and the first signs of decline to the Slytherin bloodline. During this period, the family reached perhaps its greatest public influence when Corvinus Gaunt, a direct descendant of Slytherin, served on the early Wizards' Council that preceded the Ministry of Magic. Historical accounts describe him as a commanding presence whose proposals for strict separation between magical and Muggle societies gained considerable support during the turbulent years of the Black Death, when wizard-Muggle relations reached a particularly strained point.

Yet this same century also saw the beginning of certain troubling patterns within the bloodline. The family's insistence on maintaining magical purity led to an increasingly limited pool of potential marriage partners. Some branches began the practice of cousin marriages that would eventually contribute to the deterioration of both their magical abilities and their standing in wizarding society. Corvinus Gaunt himself, despite his political accomplishments, is described in contemporary accounts as possessing "peculiarities of temperament that made him as feared as he was respected."

It was Corvinus who made perhaps the most significant contribution to preserving Slytherin's original legacy at Hogwarts. When the castle underwent extensive renovations in the 18th century, including the installation of modern plumbing that might have revealed or destroyed the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, Corvinus—who attended Hogwarts during this period—secretly ensured the entrance remained intact and functional. His diary, fragments of which survive in private collections, describes how he used his Parseltongue abilities to modify the enchantments protecting the Chamber, adapting them to incorporate the new bathroom fixtures while maintaining their essential security.

"The Chamber of my noble ancestor," he wrote, "shall remain sealed until such time as his true heir returns to complete his noble work. I have communed with the great serpent that slumbers within, assuring it that its vigil continues, though the very stones around it may shift and change."

By the 16th century, the main branch of the Slytherin line had adopted the surname Gaunt, likely derived from the appearance of certain family members whose dedication to bloodline purity had begun to take a physical toll. The Gaunts remained conscious of their illustrious ancestry, proudly tracing their lineage back to Salazar Slytherin and preserving heirlooms associated with him—most notably the locket that had been his personal talisman.

Yet even as they clung to their heritage, their position in wizarding society steadily declined. The family's once-substantial wealth dwindled through poor management and an increasing detachment from the evolving magical economy. Their political influence waned as their views came to be seen as increasingly extreme and outdated. By the 17th century, magical historians note that the Gaunts had developed a reputation for instability, with several family members displaying behaviors that suggested the genetic consequences of their intermarriage practices.

Still, the family maintained one critical distinction: the ability to speak Parseltongue. This rare magical gift, passed down from Salazar himself, served as both proof of their lineage and a source of continuing pride even as other aspects of their lives deteriorated. Imagine these later Gaunts, their once-grand manor fallen into disrepair, still hissing commands to serpents that guarded their dwindling treasures, still believing in their inherent superiority despite mounting evidence to the contrary.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw the Gaunt family's decline accelerate dramatically. They withdrew almost completely from wider wizarding society, retreating to a small cottage in the village of Little Hangleton. This dwelling, a far cry from the grand accommodations their ancestors had enjoyed, became a symbol of their fallen status—a squalid hovel decorated with the nailed skins of serpents, its door adorned with a dead snake as both warning and declaration of identity.

By this point, the family's bloodline purity practices had produced increasingly unstable individuals. Historical records from the Ministry of Magic mention repeated incidents involving Gaunts attacking Muggles in the vicinity of Little Hangleton, resulting in numerous Memory Charm interventions by the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. The once-proud guardians of Slytherin's legacy had devolved into a family infamous for its volatile behavior and increasingly tenuous grasp on their magical heritage.

Marvolo Gaunt, who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, perhaps best embodied this tragic decline. Despite residing in squalor and displaying clear signs of mental instability, he maintained a fanatical pride in his ancestry, treasuring two family heirlooms: Slytherin's locket and a ring set with the Resurrection Stone (though he remained unaware of its true significance as a Deathly Hallow). These objects represented the last tangible connections to his illustrious forebear, clutched all the more desperately as all other aspects of the family's greatness slipped away.

Marvolo's children, Morfin and Merope, represented perhaps the nadir of the Slytherin bloodline. Morfin inherited the family's instability and Parseltongue ability, using it primarily to threaten Muggles and attach snakes to their doors in disturbing displays. Merope, though possessing magical ability, was so worn down by years of abuse that she could barely perform magic while in her family's presence. The once-mighty river of Slytherin's magical prowess had dwindled to a brackish, stagnant pool.

Yet it was through Merope that the bloodline would experience its most consequential transformation. Her infatuation with a local Muggle, Tom Riddle Sr., led to a relationship that produced a son who would inherit the dormant greatness of the Slytherin line while embodying its darkest tendencies. Tom Marvolo Riddle—later known as Lord Voldemort—represented both the resurrection and perversion of Salazar Slytherin's legacy.

Born in 1926, young Tom grew up unaware of his illustrious magical ancestry, raised in a Muggle orphanage after his mother's death and his father's abandonment. Yet even without knowledge of his heritage, he displayed both the Parseltongue ability and magical power that had characterized his ancestors. When he eventually discovered his connection to Salazar Slytherin during his time at Hogwarts, it provided him with both a sense of identity and a perceived justification for his growing dark ambitions.

The cruel irony of the Slytherin bloodline's culmination in Voldemort lies in how thoroughly he both fulfilled and betrayed Salazar's legacy. While he embraced and amplified Slytherin's most controversial beliefs regarding blood purity, he himself was half-blood—the product of a witch and a Muggle, precisely the kind of magical practitioner that Slytherin had allegedly sought to exclude from Hogwarts. He used Parseltongue not as a specialized magical tool as Slytherin had, but primarily as a method of controlling deadly creatures and communicating with followers. And most significantly, he transformed Slytherin's locket—once a repository of magical knowledge—into a vessel for a fragment of his shattered soul.

Tom Riddle also fulfilled Slytherin's vision in one critical respect: he was the heir who finally opened the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing the basilisk against Muggle-born students at Hogwarts. Yet even this act represented a corruption of purpose. Where Slytherin had created the Chamber as what he viewed as a necessary safeguard for the school's future, Riddle used it primarily as a weapon of terror and a means to create his first Horcrux through the death of Myrtle Warren.

Voldemort became the last known descendant of the Slytherin bloodline, its final and most terrible flowering. With his death at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, the direct genetic lineage of Salazar Slytherin appears to have come to an end—a bloodline that survived for over a thousand years finally extinguished in the very school where its progenitor had once taught.

Yet the legacy of the bloodline extends beyond mere genetics. Harry Potter, though not a descendant of Slytherin, acquired the ability to speak Parseltongue through his connection to Voldemort. Though this ability faded after the destruction of the Horcrux within him, it represented a strange magical transference of Slytherin's most distinctive trait. Similarly, students continue to be sorted into Slytherin House at Hogwarts, many displaying the ambition, resourcefulness, and determination that Salazar valued, without sharing his more controversial views on blood status.

The embers of our fire cast long shadows now, much like the shadow that Salazar Slytherin's bloodline has cast across wizarding history. From the heights of magical accomplishment to the depths of instability and darkness, the story of this extraordinary lineage reminds us that inheritance is both gift and burden, both opportunity and constraint.

As your eyelids grow heavy and sleep beckons, consider this: What aspects of our own heritage do we choose to carry forward, and which do we leave behind? In the complex tapestry of ancestry that shapes each life, how do we honor the worthy threads while learning from the flawed patterns woven by those who came before?
