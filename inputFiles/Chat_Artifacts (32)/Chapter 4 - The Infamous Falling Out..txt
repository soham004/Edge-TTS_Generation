Chapter 4: The Infamous Falling Out.

Time weaves its tapestry in curious patterns, with threads of harmony often giving way to strands of discord. As the flames in our hearth cast dancing shadows across the walls, let us turn to perhaps the most somber chapter in the tale of Hogwarts' creation—the growing tensions and eventual schism between Salazar Slytherin and his fellow founders, a rift whose consequences would echo through wizarding history for a millennium to come.

In the early years of Hogwarts, the four founders worked in remarkable harmony despite their different temperaments and philosophies. The castle rose stone by stone, corridor by corridor, each founder contributing their unique magical gifts to create a sanctuary of learning unlike any the wizarding world had seen before. Students began to arrive—children with magical ability discovered across Britain—and the dream that had drawn four exceptional minds together was at last realized.

For a time, perhaps as long as a decade by some historical accounts, Hogwarts flourished under the guidance of its four creators. Imagine the Great Hall in those early days, with four grand chairs at the high table rather than the headmaster's throne we know today. Gryffindor with his magnificent sword at his belt, Ravenclaw with her famous diadem glittering upon her brow, Hufflepuff with her golden cup before her, and Slytherin with a locket of silver and emerald at his throat—emblems of power that would one day become scattered, hidden, and corrupted.

Yet beneath this surface of cooperation, fundamental disagreements were taking root. The most significant of these concerned the question of student admittance—specifically, whether those born to Muggle parents should be welcomed at Hogwarts. Historical records from this period are fragmentary at best, often colored by later biases, but most magical historians agree that this question became the central point of contention between Slytherin and the other founders.

Salazar Slytherin's position on this matter was complex, shaped by the experiences of his youth. Having witnessed firsthand the persecution of magical individuals by superstitious Muggle communities, he harbored deep concerns about the security risks posed by admitting Muggle-born students. In his view, these children maintained connections to the Muggle world that could potentially expose the school and its inhabitants to danger. Moreover, they had not been raised with knowledge of magical traditions and history, entering Hogwarts as outsiders to the culture they were joining.

But there was another, more practical concern that some historical accounts attribute to Slytherin—one that modern discussions often overlook. In an age before the Trace and other magical monitoring systems, when accidental magic could lead to witch-burnings, magical children in Muggle families often suppressed their abilities out of fear or were taught to hide them. By the time they reached Hogwarts age, this suppression sometimes resulted in stunted magical development. Slytherin, ever the pragmatist, allegedly argued that these students required remedial instruction that diverted resources from those whose magic had developed naturally.

Godric Gryffindor took a diametrically opposed view. Bold and idealistic, he saw magical ability as a gift that transcended birth and background. In his eyes, courage and determination were what mattered, not ancestral connections to wizarding families. Historical accounts suggest that Gryffindor was particularly moved by cases of Muggle-born children who displayed exceptional magical talent despite their disadvantaged beginnings. For him, denying these children education at Hogwarts represented not only an injustice but a squandering of magical potential.

Rowena Ravenclaw approached the question from an intellectual perspective. Contemporary accounts suggest she conducted what might be considered the first magical research studies, tracking the academic performance of students from different backgrounds. When her data showed no significant difference in magical aptitude between pure-blood and Muggle-born students who received the same instruction, she sided firmly with Gryffindor. For Ravenclaw, the pursuit of knowledge was paramount, and limiting the school based on birth seemed illogical when her evidence contradicted Slytherin's concerns about magical ability.

Helga Hufflepuff, with her inclusive nature, took perhaps the strongest stance against Slytherin's position. "I'll take the lot," she famously declared, "and teach them all the same." For Hufflepuff, Hogwarts was not merely a school but a sanctuary where any child with magical ability deserved protection and instruction. Historical accounts suggest she was particularly concerned about the fate of Muggle-born children who might otherwise face persecution without proper magical training to protect themselves.

As the years passed, these philosophical differences grew from occasional disagreements into a persistent source of tension. Imagine the founders' meetings in those later days—four powerful magical presences gathered in a tower chamber, voices rising as the same arguments were revisited with increasing frustration. Where once they had finished their discussions with compromises and shared meals, now they departed in uneasy silence, retreating to their separate domains within the castle.

Students began to notice the cooling relations between their teachers. The houses, initially conceived as merely different approaches to education, gradually took on the character of competing factions. Slytherin students, picking up on their founder's growing isolation, became more insular and defensive. The other houses, in turn, grew increasingly suspicious of Slytherin's methods and motives.

The situation reached its breaking point during what magical historians now call "The Founders' Schism." While the exact details remain shrouded in legend, most accounts agree that the final confrontation occurred after a specific incident involving a Muggle-born student. Some versions of the story suggest this student was attacked by magical creatures from the Forbidden Forest, vindicated Slytherin's warnings about Muggle-borns lacking the instinctive caution that wizard-raised children possessed. Others claim the student performed accidental magic in their home village during the holidays, leading to a mob of Muggles approaching the school—exactly the scenario Slytherin had feared.

Whatever the specific trigger, a final, catastrophic argument erupted between Slytherin and Gryffindor. Imagine them facing each other in the Great Hall, two towering magical figures at the height of their powers. Contemporary accounts describe magical energy crackling in the air around them as their debate escalated from heated words to drawn wands. Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff reportedly attempted to mediate, but the rift had grown too deep for reconciliation.

Some historical sources claim that during this confrontation, Slytherin issued an ultimatum: either the school would adopt his policy on admissions, or he would depart. Others suggest the decision to leave was made in a moment of bitter realization that his vision for Hogwarts would never be implemented. A few fringe historians even propose that Slytherin was actually forced out by the combined will of the other three founders, though most magical scholars dismiss this theory as revisionist.

The duel that some stories place at the center of this final confrontation likely contains elements of myth rather than historical fact. While the founders were indeed exceptional magical practitioners, the legendary battle that supposedly cracked the ground and blackened the sky over Hogwarts appears to be a later embellishment. More credible accounts suggest a tense magical standoff that ultimately dissolved when Slytherin, recognizing the immovability of the others' position, lowered his wand and announced his departure.

What is certain is that Salazar Slytherin left Hogwarts, never to return during his lifetime. The remaining founders, while relieved that open conflict had been avoided, faced the difficult task of explaining his absence to the students and restructuring the school's operations. Slytherin House remained, now headed by a selected teacher rather than its namesake, but its character began to change in subtle ways without Slytherin's direct influence.

The impact on the remaining founders was profound. Contemporary accounts describe Godric Gryffindor as subdued in the months following Slytherin's departure, often seen gazing from the astronomy tower in the direction Slytherin had traveled. Though they had become adversaries, the two men had once been the closest of friends, and the loss of that bond affected Gryffindor deeply. Some historians believe this experience influenced his later emphasis on loyalty as a core virtue of his house.

Rowena Ravenclaw reportedly immersed herself in research and teaching following the schism, perhaps finding in intellectual pursuits a refuge from the emotional turmoil of the founders' broken fellowship. Her enhanced focus on individual academic achievement, rather than collaborative research, dates from this period according to historical records.

Helga Hufflepuff's response to the schism revealed her remarkable capacity for compassion. Historical accounts suggest she made special efforts to support Slytherin House students, ensuring they did not feel abandoned or stigmatized by their founder's departure. Her actions helped prevent the complete isolation of Slytherin House from the rest of the school community—an isolation that might otherwise have occurred in the emotionally charged atmosphere following the schism.

The departure of Salazar Slytherin marked the end of what magical historians now call "The Founders' Era" at Hogwarts. While the remaining three continued to lead the school for many years, the dynamic vision of four complementary magical approaches working in harmony had been irreparably altered. New systems of governance gradually evolved, eventually leading to the headmaster structure familiar to modern students.

Yet even in his absence, Slytherin's influence remained. The house that bore his name continued to embody the qualities he valued: ambition, resourcefulness, cunning, and determination. The Chamber of Secrets lay dormant beneath the school, its existence fading into legend. And perhaps most significantly, the philosophical questions he raised about the relationship between the magical and Muggle worlds, about tradition versus inclusion, about security versus opportunity, continued to echo through wizarding society for centuries to come.

As our fire burns lower still, casting the room in a gentle amber glow, we might reflect on how even the most visionary collaborations can founder on the rocks of principle and personality. The embers shift in the grate, sending shadows dancing across the stones, not unlike the four founders themselves—bright flames that illuminated the wizarding world but could not, in the end, find a way to burn as one.

When deeply held convictions clash with friendship and shared purpose, what price are we willing to pay for standing firm? And is there wisdom to be found in both Slytherin's caution and Gryffindor's openness, a middle path that might have preserved their remarkable partnership had they only the perspective to see it?
