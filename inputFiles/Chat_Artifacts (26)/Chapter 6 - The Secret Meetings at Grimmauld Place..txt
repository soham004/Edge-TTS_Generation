Chapter 6: The Secret Meetings at Grimmauld Place.

Hidden in plain sight between numbers eleven and thirteen of an ordinary-looking London square stands a building invisible to Muggle eyes. As evening mist curls around the streetlamps outside, let us step through a door that appears only to those who know to look for it and enter the ancient, shadowy sanctuary that became the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix – Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place.

The noble and most ancient House of Black had maintained this townhouse as their London residence for generations. Built in the late eighteenth century during a period when wizarding families still commonly kept homes in Muggle London, the house was constructed with every magical protection and anti-Muggle enchantment available at the time. The Black family, staunch believers in pure-blood supremacy, spared no expense in creating a dwelling that would reflect their status and keep the outside world firmly at bay.

When Sirius Black inherited the property following his mother's death, the house had stood empty for nearly a decade, maintained only by the elderly house-elf Kreacher. Years of neglect had allowed magical pests to establish themselves in the darker corners, while the defensive enchantments had grown stronger in isolation, creating an atmosphere both forbidding and melancholy. It was this neglected mansion that Sirius offered to Albus Dumbledore as headquarters for the reestablished Order of the Phoenix in the summer of 1995.

The security measures protecting Number Twelve were formidable even before the Order claimed it. The house existed in a magical fold of space, unplottable and hidden between its neighboring buildings. Muggle residents of Grimmauld Place had long since unconsciously adjusted to the absence of a number twelve in their street numbering, their eyes sliding from number eleven to thirteen without registering anything unusual. To these additional protections, Dumbledore added the Fidelius Charm – that most complex of concealment spells, which hides knowledge of a location within a chosen Secret-Keeper's soul.

Imagine approaching the house for the first time, having been given the secret by Dumbledore. As you focus on the location between numbers eleven and thirteen, a battered door seems to emerge from nowhere, followed by dirty walls and grimy windows. No doorbell or knocker adorns this entrance – visitors are expected to announce themselves with their wands or to be accompanied by someone already keyed into the house's protective enchantments.

Stepping across the threshold, you would enter a hallway shrouded in darkness, illuminated only by gas lamps that cast an eerie, greenish glow over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet. The house seems to hold its breath around you, as though reluctant to fully acknowledge your presence. This entrance hall set the tone for the entire building – once grand, now faded, yet still emanating an unmistakable sense of magical power.

Perhaps the most notorious feature of this somber entryway was the life-sized portrait of Walburga Black, Sirius's mother, concealed behind moth-eaten velvet curtains. Disturbing this portrait in any way – through loud noises or simply passing too close – would cause the curtains to fly open, revealing the painting of a yellowing old woman who would immediately begin to scream invectives against "mudbloods," "blood traitors," and "creatures of filth" who dared contaminate her ancestral home. These tirades could continue for extended periods and proved nearly impossible to silence except by forcing the curtains closed through considerable effort.

Beyond the gloomy entrance hall lay a basement kitchen that became the heart of Order operations. Unlike the rest of the house, which remained largely untouched due to the extensive magical contamination, the kitchen was scrubbed to reasonable cleanliness through the combined efforts of Molly Weasley and the reluctant assistance of Kreacher. A large, carved wooden table dominated the center of the room, surrounded by mismatched chairs that accommodated up to twenty people during full Order meetings.

It was around this table that the most significant gatherings took place. Imagine the scene: the flickering light of enchanted candles casting long shadows across the stone walls; the gentle bubbling of a cauldron kept perpetually simmering in the massive fireplace; Order members arriving in ones and twos, shaking rain from their cloaks or stamping snow from their boots depending on the season. Dumbledore would typically take position at the head of the table, his half-moon spectacles reflecting the candlelight as he called these clandestine assemblies to order.

The topics discussed during these meetings covered every aspect of resistance against Lord Voldemort's growing power. Reports from Severus Snape regarding Death Eater activities were delivered in his characteristic low, measured tones. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Nymphadora Tonks provided updates on Ministry positions and potential allies or threats within the government. Arthur Weasley shared information about mysterious objects or occurrences that might indicate Death Eater activity. Most crucially, plans were made for the protection of key targets – including Harry Potter and the prophecy stored in the Department of Mysteries.

Security during these gatherings was paramount. Before each meeting, protective enchantments would be reinforced around the house. Mundungus Fletcher, despite his questionable character, proved valuable in setting up warning systems that would alert Order members to any magical surveillance. Conversations about particularly sensitive topics were often conducted under Muffliato charms as an additional precaution against magical eavesdropping.

Not all time at Grimmauld Place was devoted to strategic planning. Between formal meetings, the house served as a temporary residence for various Order members. Sirius Black, of course, was confined there almost permanently – a painful irony that he had escaped one prison only to find himself trapped in another, the childhood home he had once fled. Remus Lupin stayed frequently during periods when he wasn't undertaking dangerous missions among werewolf communities. The Weasley family took up residence during the summer of 1995 while helping to make the house habitable, and again during the Christmas holidays of that year.

Daily life at headquarters had its own rhythm. Mornings often began with Molly Weasley preparing breakfast for whoever had spent the night, the comforting aroma of cooking temporarily masking the persistent smell of damp and decay that permeated the building. Order members would come and go throughout the day, sometimes stopping only long enough to deliver a message before departing on another mission. Evenings frequently saw smaller, informal strategy sessions around the kitchen table, often continuing long into the night.

The maintenance of the house itself posed significant challenges. Decades of magical neglect had allowed various magical infestations to take hold. Doxies nested in the curtains, a boggart lurked in a rattling writing desk, and pixies had established colonies in several forgotten rooms. The task of clearing these pests fell primarily to those too young to join the Order – namely the Weasley children, Hermione Granger, and eventually Harry Potter – supervised by Molly Weasley and occasionally assisted by other Order members between missions.

Perhaps the greatest complication in maintaining Grimmauld Place was the presence of Kreacher, the ancient house-elf who had served the Black family for most of his life. Deeply loyal to the memory of his former mistress and indoctrinated with the Black family's pure-blood supremacist values, Kreacher initially regarded the Order's presence as a desecration. He would mutter insults under his breath, attempt to salvage Black family heirlooms from the cleaning efforts, and occasionally sabotage Order activities in small ways. His relationship with Sirius was particularly antagonistic, colored by decades of mutual resentment.

The upper floors of Grimmauld Place contained numerous bedrooms in various states of decay, allotted to Order members as needed. Most striking among these was the room that had belonged to Sirius in his youth – its walls permanently adorned with Gryffindor banners and Muggle motorcycle posters, all fixed with Permanent Sticking Charms as a deliberate provocation against his Slytherin-proud parents. In stark contrast was Regulus Black's room, preserved almost as a shrine with its green and silver Slytherin decorations and the family motto "Toujours Pur" – Always Pure – prominently displayed.

The drawing room on the first floor served as a secondary meeting space, particularly for smaller gatherings or when the kitchen was occupied with meal preparation. This room housed the Black family tapestry – an enormous, moth-eaten cloth embroidered with the family tree dating back to the Middle Ages. Names of family members who had married Muggles or otherwise "betrayed" the family values had been blasted off, leaving only scorched holes where once their names had been stitched in gold. Sirius would sometimes stand before this tapestry, contemplating the holes that represented himself and other relatives who had rejected the pure-blood mania of their ancestors.

Throughout the house, evidence of the Black family's dark magical leanings could be found in the decoration and artifacts. Silver snuffboxes that bit unwary fingers, curtains that attempted to strangle those who drew them, and a grandfather clock that shot heavy bolts at passersby were among the more benign items. More sinister artifacts – including those suspected of being genuinely Dark – were carefully collected by Sirius and Remus for secure disposal or, when necessary, containment.

Some of the most significant decisions of the Second Wizarding War were made within these walls. The plan to move Harry Potter from Privet Drive to the Burrow, the coordination of guard duty for the Department of Mysteries, strategies for recruiting potential allies – all were formulated around the scarred kitchen table or in hushed conversations in the drawing room. When Arthur Weasley was attacked by Nagini while guarding the prophecy, it was to Grimmauld Place that the Weasley children were brought for safety, even as their father fought for his life in St. Mungo's Hospital.

The Order maintained a collection of important magical items at headquarters as well. Alastor Moody's collection of Dark Detectors – including Sneakoscopes, Secrecy Sensors, and his infamous Foe-Glass – were kept in various strategic locations throughout the house. Communication devices like enchanted parchment and emergency Portkeys were stored in a locked cabinet in the kitchen, accessible only to full Order members. A small but carefully curated library of defensive magical texts occupied a section of the drawing room, referenced frequently during planning sessions.

The fire burns lower now as our exploration of Grimmauld Place draws to a close. The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix served as more than merely a meeting location – it was a sanctuary, a symbol of resistance, and ultimately a microcosm of the wizarding world itself: a place where the dark legacy of prejudice was gradually being cleansed through the efforts of those committed to a more inclusive vision of magical society.

After Sirius Black's death in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, ownership of the house passed unexpectedly to Harry Potter rather than to Narcissa Malfoy or Bellatrix Lestrange, as might have been expected by traditional wizarding inheritance customs. This transfer served as a final rejection of the pure-blood values the house had long represented and transformed it from a monument to magical elitism into a base for those fighting against such prejudice.

As sleep begins to claim your consciousness, perhaps consider this question: How do the spaces we inhabit shape our perceptions and values? What would it mean to reclaim a place built on darkness and transform it into a sanctuary of light, as the Order did with Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place?
