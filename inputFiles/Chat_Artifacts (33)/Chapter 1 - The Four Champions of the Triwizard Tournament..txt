Chapter 1: The Four Champions of the Triwizard Tournament.

Oh, a new visitor from the woods. Welcome. Are you a lost wanderer, tired from a long journey? Then join me, sit beside the fireplace, and let me tell you some stories that may soothe your mood as you regain your strength.

You all set? Good. Let's start the story with one of the most extraordinary events in recent wizarding history—the revival of the legendary Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the academic year of 1994-1995.

Picture yourself within the Great Hall of Hogwarts. The enchanted ceiling mirrors a night sky sprinkled with stars, thousands of candles float in mid-air, casting their gentle glow upon the expectant faces of students below. The air is thick with anticipation, with whispers and theories exchanged between students from three prestigious magical schools: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, and Durmstrang Institute.

In the center of the hall stands a roughly hewn wooden goblet, its rim dancing with blue-white flames that illuminate the surrounding stone floor with an ethereal light. This is the Goblet of Fire—an impartial judge tasked with selecting one champion from each school to compete in three dangerous tasks. The tournament, once a celebrated tradition, had been discontinued centuries ago due to its mounting death toll. Now, with new safety measures in place, the magical community had decided to revive this ancient competition.

The selection process was designed to be straightforward. Students who wished to compete would submit their names on parchment into the Goblet of Fire, and on Halloween night, the Goblet would return the names of those it deemed most worthy to represent their schools. To prevent underage students from entering, Albus Dumbledore himself had drawn an Age Line around the Goblet—a powerful spell that repelled anyone under seventeen years of age.

When the moment of selection arrived, the Great Hall fell silent. The first name that emerged from the Goblet, carried by a tongue of red flame, belonged to Viktor Krum of Durmstrang Institute. Known throughout the wizarding world as Bulgaria's star Seeker, Krum was a brooding figure with dark eyes and a curved nose that had been broken more than once. His selection surprised few; despite his fame on the Quidditch pitch, Krum was also a dedicated student with considerable magical talent.

The second name belonged to Fleur Delacour of Beauxbatons Academy. With silvery-blonde hair that seemed to emit a faint, glowing aura, Fleur carried herself with graceful confidence. She was part-Veela, giving her not only striking beauty but also access to unique magical abilities. Behind her delicate appearance lay a fierce determination and impressive spell-casting skills that had earned her the Goblet's selection.

Hogwarts' champion was Cedric Diggory, a handsome, tall Hufflepuff student with gray eyes and an honest face. Cedric embodied the qualities his house valued: he was fair, hardworking, and loyal. His selection was met with thunderous applause from his fellow Hufflepuffs, who rarely received the glory often reserved for other houses. Cedric's exceptional abilities in Transfiguration and Defense Against the Dark Arts, coupled with his natural leadership, made him a worthy representative.

And then, something unprecedented occurred. The Goblet flared red once more, ejecting a fourth piece of parchment. In disbelief, Dumbledore read the name: Harry Potter.

The announcement sent shockwaves through the Great Hall. Harry Potter—underaged at merely fourteen—stood frozen in shock. He had not entered his name, yet somehow he had been selected as an unexpected fourth champion. The rules of the tournament, bound by magical contract, meant that Harry had no choice but to compete alongside champions who were older, more experienced, and had voluntarily entered.

This anomaly created immediate tension. Many believed Harry had somehow circumvented the Age Line, seeking further fame to add to his already considerable reputation as "The Boy Who Lived." The Hogwarts student body, particularly those loyal to Cedric, felt Harry was stealing Hufflepuff's rare moment of glory. Meanwhile, the visiting schools viewed this unexpected addition as evidence that Hogwarts was attempting to increase its chances of victory through duplicity.

The selection of four champions rather than three cast a shadow over the tournament before it had even begun. Whispers of foul play and speculation about who might have entered Harry's name permeated the castle corridors. Professor Moody, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, suggested a darker possibility: that someone had entered Harry's name hoping he would not survive the tournament's dangers.

In the weeks that followed, the champions prepared for their first task. They were told only that it would test their daring and courage in the face of the unknown—a fitting beginning for a tournament steeped in both glory and danger. While the other champions could rely on the support of their respective schools, Harry found himself isolated, bearing not only the burden of unexpected competition but also the weight of general suspicion and resentment.

As the first task approached, the four champions could be seen wandering the castle grounds, each absorbed in their thoughts and preparations. Viktor maintained his stoic demeanor, often seeking solitude in the library. Fleur practiced complex charms by the lake, the water's surface occasionally rippling in response to her magic. Cedric, popular and well-liked, was often surrounded by supporters offering encouragement and assistance. And Harry, carrying the additional burden of his unwanted selection, searched desperately for strategies that might help him survive what lay ahead.

Despite their differing circumstances, these four individuals were bound together by the magical contract of the Goblet of Fire. Their selection marked them as extraordinary among their peers—each possessing unique qualities and abilities that would be tested to their limits in the trials to come. Bravery, intelligence, skill, and character—all would prove necessary in the dangerous competition that awaited them.

The tension between rivalry and fair play, between school pride and personal achievement, between fame and survival—these were the currents that flowed through the lives of the four Triwizard champions. Their journeys through the tournament would not only test their magical abilities but would also reveal the true nature of their characters, forging bonds and rivalries that none could have anticipated on that fateful Halloween night when the Goblet of Fire made its selections.

As our tale of the champions' selection comes to a close, consider this: If you were to stand before the Goblet of Fire, what qualities within you might cause it to select you as champion? And more importantly, would you have the wisdom to understand the true cost of glory?
