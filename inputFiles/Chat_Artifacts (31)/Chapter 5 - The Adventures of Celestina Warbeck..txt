Chapter 5: The Adventures of Celestina Warbeck.

The soft crackle of a gramophone needle touching vinyl fills the evening air as haunting, melodious notes begin to flow like honey through the room. That unmistakable voice—powerful yet delicate, commanding yet intimate—can belong to only one witch: Celestina Warbeck, the Singing Sorceress, whose enchanting performances have captivated the wizarding world for decades. Tonight, we delve into the remarkable life of a witch whose voice has provided the soundtrack to countless magical lives.

Celestina was born on August 18, 1917, to a Muggle father and a witch mother in Wales. Her mother, Calliope, had been a failed performer herself and recognized her daughter's extraordinary vocal talent almost immediately. According to family lore, Celestina sang before she spoke, producing perfect musical notes that caused the family's pet Kneazle to purr in harmony.

From her earliest days, Celestina's magic manifested in connection with her voice. When she sang lullabies to herself in her crib, small objects around her nursery would rise and dance in mid-air. When upset, her wails could crack windows—a phenomenon her Muggle father attributed to his wife's "artistic temperament" rather than infant magic. By the age of seven, she could charm butterflies to flutter in formation around her as she sang in the garden, much to the amazement of her Muggle neighbors.

Her Hogwarts letter arrived in the summer of 1928, and young Celestina was sorted into Gryffindor House. While a competent student in most subjects, she truly excelled in Charms, where her natural affinity for music enhanced her spellcasting. Professor Herbert Beery, who taught both Herbology and directed the school's Frog Choir in those days, immediately recognized her potential and invited her to join the choir in her first year—a rare honor usually reserved for older students.

Within a term, Celestina had become the Frog Choir's lead vocalist, her voice blending magically with the bass croaking of the toads and frogs. Her rendition of "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love"—a song that would later become her signature hit—was performed at the school's Christmas feast when she was just thirteen, bringing tears to Professor Beery's eyes and a standing ovation from the entire Great Hall.

During her fifth year at Hogwarts, Celestina's life changed forever when she was discovered by Orpheus Orbs, a talent scout for the Wizarding Wireless Network who had come to judge the school's annual talent competition. Her performance of an original composition, "Spellbound," caused every candle in the Great Hall to flare three feet high in response to her crescendo. Orbs approached her immediately after the show, offering her a summer internship at the WWN studios in London.

That summer, Celestina recorded her first wireless single, "You Stole My Cauldron But You Can't Have My Heart," which climbed to number three on the Wizarding Wireless charts. By the time she returned to Hogwarts for her sixth year, her fellow students were requesting autographs, and professors were making accommodations for her increasingly frequent weekend performances.

After completing her N.E.W.T.s with respectable scores (including an Outstanding in Charms), Celestina signed a full contract with the Wizarding Wireless Network and began her professional career in earnest. Her first album, "Spells and Serenades," was released in 1936 and sold out its initial pressing within a week. Reviewers praised her "bewitching tone" and "spellbinding emotional range," with one writer for Witch Weekly declaring her "the voice that will define a generation."

It was during the recording of her second album that Celestina first collaborated with the backing singers who would become an integral part of her signature sound: the Banshees. This group of three witches had been performing as a harmony trio called "The Veela's Charm" (despite none of them having Veela ancestry). Their ethereal backing vocals provided the perfect counterpoint to Celestina's powerful lead, creating a sound unlike anything previously heard on the Wizarding Wireless.

The addition of the Banshees coincided with Celestina's development of her flamboyant performance style. Unlike the more reserved magical performers of the era, who typically stood still while singing, Celestina incorporated dramatic movements, costume changes, and pyrotechnic wand work into her shows. Her signature move—a high note held while spinning in place, causing sparks of light to emanate from the tip of her wand in expanding circles—became known as "The Warbeck Whirl" and is still imitated by young performers today.

The outbreak of the Muggle Second World War and Grindelwald's simultaneous rise to power temporarily halted Celestina's touring schedule, but not her recording career. During this dark period, her music took on a more patriotic tone, with songs like "Stand Tall (For Magic is Might)" and "United We Cast" becoming anthems of resistance against dark forces. She performed frequent benefit concerts for displaced magical families and wounded Aurors, donating her considerable earnings to relief efforts.

It was at one such benefit concert that she met her first husband, Alfonso Warbeck, a Spanish wizard who had fled Grindelwald's forces on the continent. Their whirlwind romance resulted in marriage just three months later—the first of what would eventually be three marriages for the passionate singer. The relationship lasted seven years and produced her only child, a son named Orpheus after the talent scout who had discovered her.

Celestina's career reached new heights in the post-war years as magical Britain embraced celebration and entertainment after the long period of fear and restraint. Her 1950 album "Enchanting Evenings" is widely regarded as her masterpiece, featuring the perennial favorite "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love" alongside other classics like "You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me" and "Beat Back Those Bludgers, Boys, and Chuck That Quaffle Here."

Her live performances became legendary for their magical spectacle. During the chorus of "Hot, Strong Love," actual cauldrons would appear above the audience, tipping to release cascades of red rose petals that dissolved into heart-shaped puffs of steam before reaching the crowd. For "Bludgers," enchanted Quidditch balls would zoom harmlessly through the venue, narrowly missing audience members to their delighted shrieks. The Ministry occasionally expressed concern about the complexity of the magic being performed in public venues, but no regulations were ever enacted—perhaps because several high-ranking Ministry officials were devoted fans.

The 1960s saw a shift in wizarding musical tastes toward more youth-oriented bands like the Hobgoblins, but Celestina's career never truly waned. She adapted by collaborating with younger artists and refreshing her repertoire while maintaining the classic sound her fans loved. Her fashion sense evolved as well, embracing increasingly elaborate robes in vibrant colors, often adorned with magical elements like color-changing sequins or miniature animated patterns.

Her personal life generated nearly as much interest as her musical career. Following her divorce from Alfonso Warbeck (who reportedly could not cope with her fame and touring schedule), she married Irving Warble, a music producer, in 1958. That marriage lasted twelve years before ending amicably. Her third and final marriage, to Rudolph Wintringham, a talented flutist with the Weird Sisters Philharmonic Orchestra, began in 1974 and continued until his death in 2017.

Throughout these relationships, Celestina maintained a dignified public persona, refusing to perform "tell-all" songs about her ex-husbands or engage in the sort of public squabbles that characterized some celebrities' lives. "My voice is for lifting spirits, not settling scores," she once told Witch Weekly in a rare interview about her personal life.

Beyond her musical career, Celestina's philanthropic work has left an indelible mark on wizarding society. The Warbeck Foundation for Magical Medical Research, established after her mother died of a rare magical malady in 1971, has funded breakthroughs in the treatment of spell damage and magical ailments. Her annual Christmas benefit concert at St. Mungo's has been a tradition for over fifty years, bringing cheer to patients and raising thousands of Galleons for the hospital.

During the First Wizarding War, Celestina's music once again became a source of comfort and unity. Though advised to leave Britain for her safety, she refused, stating, "If my voice can bring even a moment's joy in these dark times, then I have a duty to sing." She performed numerous secret concerts for wizarding communities under threat, often arriving disguised and revealing herself only when she began to sing.

The return of Voldemort in the 1990s again found Celestina using her platform for resistance, though in more subtle ways. While the Ministry denied Voldemort's return, her 1996 single "The Truth Has a Voice" was widely interpreted as a statement of support for Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore. After Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry, her music was briefly banned from the Wizarding Wireless Network—an action that backfired when underground "Celestina clubs" began forming to share and play her music in secret, often serving as covers for resistance meetings.

In the years following the Second Wizarding War, Celestina has reduced her performance schedule but continues to record new music. Her 2000 album "Century's Turn" introduced her to a new generation of fans, while 2010's "Spellbound: The Orchestral Sessions" reimagined her greatest hits with the backing of the full Weird Sisters Philharmonic Orchestra.

Now in her later years, Celestina remains a beloved figure in the wizarding world. Young witches and wizards may pretend to find her music old-fashioned to the amusement of their parents, but few can resist singing along when "A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love" plays on the wireless. Her annual Christmas special remains the most-watched program on the Wizarding Wireless Visual Network, and her occasional surprise appearances at magical events still cause a sensation.

Molly Weasley, one of her most devoted fans, perhaps best summarized Celestina's enduring appeal: "Her music reminds us of better times and helps us believe they'll come again. In the darkest days, that's a kind of magic all its own."

The gramophone in the corner continues its gentle rotation, the needle following the grooves that capture that unmistakable voice. The room seems warmer somehow, more secure, as if wrapped in the musical enchantment that has comforted generations of witches and wizards through both celebration and sorrow.

As the final notes of "You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me" fade into the night, consider this: What melodies have woven themselves so deeply into your own life's story that they can transport you across time and space with just a few notes?
