Chapter 7: The Riddle House.

Beyond the village of Little Hangleton, standing stark against the twilight sky, looms a once-grand manor that holds secrets darker than the gathering shadows beneath its eaves. The Riddle House, as the locals call it, sits on a hill overlooking the village—watching, waiting, remembering. Tonight, we shall trace the history of this imposing dwelling, whose walls have witnessed both Muggle tragedy and magical malevolence, a place where the disparate worlds of wizard and non-wizard collided with consequences that would echo through generations.

The house was built in the late Georgian period, around 1810, by a wealthy industrialist named Thaddeus Riddle who had made his fortune in textile manufacturing during Britain's industrial revolution. The architecture reflects the prosperity and confidence of that era—a symmetrical facade of honey-colored stone, tall windows designed to capture light, and an impressive portico supported by classical columns. In its prime, the house boasted over thirty rooms, including a grand ballroom where the local gentry would gather for lavish social events that were the talk of the county.

For generations, the Riddle family maintained their position as the wealthiest and most influential residents of Little Hangleton. They employed much of the village, owned most of the surrounding land, and held positions of authority in local governance. This prominence came with a certain aloofness that did not endear them to their neighbors. The Riddles were respected, certainly, but rarely loved—a family that inspired deference rather than affection.

By the early twentieth century, the family had dwindled to just three members: Thomas Riddle and his wife Mary, and their handsome son Tom. Thomas had inherited not only the family estate but also his ancestors' haughty demeanor. Mary shared her husband's sense of superiority, and young Tom grew up with an inflated sense of his own importance. Handsome and charming when he wished to be, Tom Riddle was the subject of much admiration among the young women of the village, though he showed little genuine interest in any of them.

The Riddles' comfortable life proceeded undisturbed until the summer of 1925, when young Tom suddenly and inexplicably eloped with Merope Gaunt, the daughter of the disreputable Gaunt family who lived in a dilapidated cottage on the outskirts of the village. The match was considered scandalous by all who knew of it. The Gaunts were notorious for their strange behavior, apparent poverty, and unsanitary living conditions. Merope herself was plain in appearance and known to be peculiar.

What the Muggle villagers could not know was that Merope was a witch, descended from Salazar Slytherin himself, though years of isolation and inbreeding had left the family's magical abilities diminished. In a desperate bid to escape her abusive father and brother, and driven by an obsessive infatuation with the handsome Tom Riddle, Merope had used a love potion to ensnare him.

Tom Riddle Sr. remained under the influence of this enchantment for nearly a year, during which time Merope became pregnant. Whether from a misguided belief that he had grown to genuinely love her, or perhaps due to the difficulties of continuing to administer the potion while pregnant, Merope eventually stopped giving Tom the love potion. The enchantment broken, he abandoned his wife and unborn child immediately, fleeing back to his parents at the Riddle House.

In the aftermath of this shameful episode, the Riddles withdrew even further from village life. Tom Riddle Sr. rarely left the estate, spending his days riding his horses on the grounds or sitting silently in the library. Thomas and Mary circulated a story that their son had been "taken in" by the Gaunt girl, implying some form of deception or trickery—ironically closer to the truth than they could have known. The villagers, for their part, were all too happy to gossip about the scandal behind the Riddles' backs while maintaining a facade of respect to their faces.

Meanwhile, Merope Gaunt, destitute and heartbroken, made her way to London where, on New Year's Eve 1926, she gave birth to a son in an orphanage. With her dying breath, she named the boy Tom Marvolo Riddle after his father and her own father, Marvolo. This child, raised in the Muggle orphanage without knowledge of his magical heritage, would grow to become Lord Voldemort—and the Riddle House would eventually play a pivotal role in his dark journey.

For sixteen years, the Riddles continued their isolated existence, unaware of the half-blood wizard child who carried their name and harbored a growing darkness within him. The manor house, once a center of local society, became a symbol of faded grandeur and mysterious seclusion. Gardens that had once been the pride of the county fell into less manicured states, though they were still maintained by a skeleton staff, including the gardener Frank Bryce, who had returned from war with a stiff leg and a preference for solitude that matched his employers'.

The summer of 1943 brought the event that would forever cement the Riddle House in local infamy. On a warm August morning, the maid arrived to find all three Riddles dead in the drawing room. Thomas and Mary sat on the sofa, while Tom occupied an armchair near the fireplace. All three were described as looking utterly terrified, yet there was no sign of injury or struggle. The doors had been locked from the inside, the windows secured. No poison was found in their evening tea.

The police investigation focused initially on Frank Bryce, who claimed to have seen a pale, dark-haired teenage boy walking up toward the house on the evening of the deaths. With no other leads and pressure to solve the case, the local authorities arrested Frank, but were ultimately forced to release him due to lack of evidence. The official cause of death was recorded as heart failure brought on by shock or fright—an explanation that satisfied no one but closed the case in the absence of alternatives.

What the Muggle authorities could never have determined was that sixteen-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle, having discovered his parentage and located his Muggle father, had visited the Riddle House that night. In his first significant act of darkness, he murdered his father and grandparents with the Killing Curse, framed his maternal uncle Morfin Gaunt for the crime, and returned to Hogwarts with the Gaunt family ring as a trophy.

After the tragedy, the Riddle House passed through a succession of owners, none of whom resided there for long. Local rumors claimed the house was haunted, that strange sounds could be heard at night, that plants in the garden withered unnaturally. These rumors were fueled partly by Frank Bryce, who continued to live in his cottage on the grounds and maintained the gardens out of a sense of duty, despite the suspicion with which villagers regarded him.

The house fell into increasing disrepair as the decades passed. Rooms were closed off as roof leaks developed, fine furniture was covered with dust cloths, and gardens became less formal though still maintained by the aging Frank. By the 1990s, the once-proud manor was owned by a wealthy businessman who never visited, keeping it only for tax purposes and employing Frank as a caretaker more out of inertia than necessity.

In the summer of 1994, the Riddle House once again became the setting for dark events when Lord Voldemort, reduced to a barely corporeal form after his failed attempt to kill Harry Potter, took refuge there with his servant Peter Pettigrew. The symmetry was both practical and symbolic—Voldemort returning to the home of the father he had murdered, the place where his journey toward darkness had advanced significantly.

The great house, by then a shadow of its former glory, provided the isolation Voldemort needed as he regained strength and planned his return to power. The once-grand drawing room, where his father and grandparents had died by his hand, became the setting for his temporary residence and the place where he received reports from his Death Eaters.

Frank Bryce, still living in his cottage at the age of seventy-seven, noticed lights in the supposedly empty house one night and went to investigate, believing vandals had broken in. Instead, he overheard Voldemort and Pettigrew discussing their plans, including the murder of a boy. Before he could alert authorities, Frank was discovered and killed by Voldemort—the second Muggle to die in that house at the Dark Lord's hand.

After Voldemort's departure for the Quidditch World Cup and subsequently to position Barty Crouch Jr. at Hogwarts, the Riddle House stood empty once more. Following the Dark Lord's resurrection in the graveyard of Little Hangleton in June 1995, he did not return to the house, preferring more secure and magically protected locations for his operations.

The physical contrast between the grand Riddle House and the decrepit Gaunt shack nearby represented the stark division between Voldemort's Muggle and magical heritage—both of which he came to despise. The Riddle House symbolized the wealth and privilege from which he had been excluded by his father's abandonment, while the Gaunt shack represented the fallen state of what had once been a proud magical lineage.

In the years following Voldemort's final defeat, the Riddle House continued its slow decline. With Frank Bryce gone and no new caretaker appointed, the gardens grew wild, and the structure began to fail. Roof tiles slipped from their positions during winter storms, windows cracked and were not repaired, and ivy began to reclaim the walls as nature slowly erased the evidence of human habitation.

By 2020, only the foundations and partial walls remained, with nature steadily reclaiming the site. Local Muggle authorities eventually declared the ruins unsafe and restricted access, though this did not prevent occasional trespassing by thrill-seeking teenagers or the odd visitor with a peculiar interest in the site of the mysterious Riddle deaths.

The Ministry of Magic maintains subtle monitoring charms on the area, as they do at all locations with significant connections to Voldemort's history. These are designed to detect any unusual magical activity that might indicate dark wizards attempting to establish some connection with the fallen Dark Lord. So far, these monitors have detected nothing beyond the occasional curious magical tourist paying their respects to the site of Harry Potter's famous confrontation in the nearby graveyard.

For those sensitive to magical resonances, the ruins of the Riddle House still emanate a faint aura of darkness. This is not surprising, as violent deaths—particularly those caused by Unforgivable Curses—leave traces that linger for generations. Some magical historians have suggested that the multiple deaths that occurred there, separated by decades but connected by blood and malice, created a kind of magical echo that reinforces itself over time.

The local Muggles of Little Hangleton have their own relationship with the ruins on the hill. Most avoid the area, claiming it feels "wrong" or "cold" even on warm days. Some of the older residents still tell stories of the mysterious Riddle deaths and Frank Bryce's strange end, though with each retelling, the tales grow more elaborate and less accurate. Few connect these events with the odd happenings at the old graveyard in the summer of 1995, which most attribute to vandalism or storm damage.

The shadows lengthen across what was once a grand entry hall as we conclude our exploration of this significant location in wizarding history. The Riddle House stands as a monument to how the choices of one generation ripple forward to affect those that follow, how hatred and rejection can create wounds that fester across decades, and how places themselves can become repositories for the darkest aspects of human experience—whether magical or Muggle.

As the last light fades from the ruins of what was once the finest house in the village, consider this: What legacies do we leave in the places we inhabit, and how might the emotions we experience within those walls—love, hatred, fear, or hope—linger long after we ourselves are gone?
