Chapter 11: The Home of Bathilda Bagshot.

Dwellings often embody the spirit of those who inhabit them, each room revealing something of the occupant's character, interests, and life's work. As our evening's journey continues beneath a canopy of twinkling stars, let us turn down a quiet lane in Godric's Hollow to explore a cottage both humble and extraordinary—the home of wizarding Britain's preeminent magical historian, Bathilda Bagshot.

Nestled on the eastern edge of Godric's Hollow, set slightly apart from the village center, stands a stone cottage that has witnessed centuries of magical history unfold. The exterior appears unremarkable by wizarding standards—weathered limestone walls partly covered with climbing roses, a slate roof patched in places, and windows of varying sizes that hint at expansions and modifications across generations. A low stone wall separates the small front garden from the lane, with an iron gate whose hinges have creaked welcomingly for visitors since before the International Statute of Secrecy was established.

For over a century and a half, this modest dwelling was home to the extraordinary witch who chronicled wizarding history more comprehensively than any before her. Born in 1840, Bathilda Bagshot began her historical research in her twenties, initially focusing on medieval magical communities in Britain. By the time she purchased the cottage in Godric's Hollow in her mid-thirties, she had already published several well-regarded papers on the formation of early wizarding villages and their relationship with nearby Muggle settlements.

The choice of Godric's Hollow was no coincidence. As one of Britain's earliest wizarding settlements, with direct connections to Godric Gryffindor himself, the village offered both historical significance and a community where magical and non-magical residents had coexisted relatively peacefully for centuries. For Bagshot, whose historical approach emphasized the interconnection between wizarding and Muggle histories rather than treating them as entirely separate streams, this environment perfectly complemented her academic perspective.

Upon crossing the threshold into Bathilda's home, visitors were immediately struck by the curious blend of domestic comfort and academic workshop that defined the space. The entrance hall, narrow but welcoming, featured a hatstand enchanted to adjust its height for visitors of varying statures, from the diminutive Professor Flitwick to Hagrid's imposing frame. Photographs of historical sites and notable magical historians lined the walls, their subjects occasionally slipping between frames to continue longstanding academic debates that had begun during Bathilda's lifetime.

The heart of the cottage was undoubtedly the library-study that occupied the entire eastern wing—an extension charmed to be considerably larger inside than the cottage's exterior would suggest. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined every wall, housing what many considered the most comprehensive private collection of historical texts in wizarding Britain. Works in dozens of languages filled these shelves, from crumbling scrolls in Ancient Greek to pristine first editions of contemporary magical scholarship.

The organizational system defied conventional logic, arranged instead according to Bathilda's unique conceptual framework that placed works in conversation with each other across time periods and geographical boundaries. Only the historian herself could navigate this labyrinth of knowledge with confidence, though she maintained a small self-updating index that provided visitors with the general vicinity of texts on specific subjects.

At the center of this literary maze stood Bathilda's writing desk—a massive oak piece dating to the 17th century, its surface scarred by ink stains and burn marks from centuries of magical scholarship. The desk faced a large bay window overlooking her herb garden, positioned to capture the morning light that Bathilda preferred for her writing. A series of enchanted quills stood ready in crystal holders, each calibrated for different types of notation—research notes, correspondence, draft manuscripts, and final text.

Above the desk hung a remarkable magical artifact: a three-dimensional timeline of wizarding history that Bathilda had created over decades of research. Golden threads connected events, places, and people in a complex web that adjusted and expanded as new information was incorporated. This visualization tool allowed her to identify patterns and connections across centuries that might otherwise remain obscured in linear historical narratives.

The library also housed Bathilda's pensieve—one of the few privately owned specimens in Britain. Unlike more conventional models, hers featured modifications specifically designed for historical research. Memory strands placed within it could be filtered by location, date, or subject, allowing for precise examination of specific historical details without requiring complete immersion in the memory. This innovation proved especially valuable as Bathilda entered her elder years and found extended pensieve sessions increasingly taxing.

Adjacent to the library, a cozy sitting room served as the space where Bathilda received visitors. Comfortable armchairs upholstered in faded floral patterns surrounded a perpetually burning fireplace—enchanted to adjust its warmth according to the season and the number of occupants in the room. A tea service enchanted to maintain perfect temperature stood ready on a side table, accompanied by a cookie jar that family friend Lily Potter had charmed to replenish itself daily with fresh ginger biscuits—Bathilda's favorite.

The walls of this room displayed Bathilda's personal historical treasures: a fragment of parchment bearing Merlin's handwriting, a small vial of sand from the lost wizarding island of Atlantis, and most prominently, a family tree showing her distant relationship to Gellert Grindelwald. Bathilda never concealed this connection, believing that history required transparency from its chroniclers, especially regarding potentially biasing personal associations.

The cottage's modest kitchen maintained a curious blend of magical convenience and historical authenticity. While a modern magical stove had been installed in the 1950s, Bathilda also preserved the original hearth with its iron pots and cooking implements, occasionally using these older methods to prepare recipes documented in historical texts she studied. Her herb garden, visible through the kitchen window, contained not only culinary plants but also rare magical specimens collected during research expeditions across Europe.

The upper floor of the cottage contained Bathilda's personal quarters and guest rooms that hosted numerous distinguished visitors over the decades. The historian's bedroom was notably spartan compared to the intellectual richness of her library—a simple iron bedstead, a wardrobe containing practical robes in subdued colors, and a nightstand stacked with whatever texts she was currently reviewing before sleep. The only decorative elements were detailed maps of ancient magical settlements on the walls and a collection of crystallized potion ingredients arranged on the windowsill, their facets catching the morning light.

More revealing was the guest room that, for several months in 1899, housed a young Gellert Grindelwald during his fateful visit to Godric's Hollow. Bathilda later preserved this room exactly as he left it—not from family sentiment but as a historical record of the formative period when Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore developed their early plans and philosophies. The room contained bookshelves filled with texts on magical theory, several journals with pages torn out (the missing pages presumably containing the most controversial ideas), and a small writing desk where Grindelwald drafted early versions of the arguments that would later fuel his rise to power.

Bathilda permitted serious magical historians to study this room under strict supervision, believing that understanding the intellectual origins of dangerous movements was essential to preventing their recurrence. This decision proved controversial among some colleagues who felt it showed inappropriate respect for Grindelwald's ideas, but Bathilda maintained that historical understanding required examining even the darkest chapters without sanitization.

Throughout the cottage, evidence of Bathilda's correspondence with the wider wizarding world overflowed from drawers, folders, and cabinets. As the author of "A History of Magic"—the definitive historical text used at Hogwarts for generations—she received constant owls from students, educators, and researchers seeking clarification or offering new information. She maintained this extensive correspondence well into her eleventh decade, personally responding to thoughtful queries while directing more basic questions to a self-answering index she had developed for frequently discussed topics.

The cottage basement housed Bathilda's archive—a temperature-controlled space where she preserved original documents, artifacts, and research materials too delicate or valuable for regular handling. Specialized preservation charms maintained optimal conditions for parchment, textiles, and magical objects, while a complex series of cataloging spells allowed her to locate specific items within seconds. This archive represented one of the most significant private collections of historical materials in Britain, much of which would eventually be donated to the Department of Magical History at the Ministry following her death.

As decades passed, the cottage began to reflect Bathilda's advancing age. Self-maintaining charms that once kept the space immaculately organized gradually weakened as her magical energy diminished. Dust gathered in corners, books migrated from their proper places, and the enchanted household implements became somewhat erratic in their functions. Despite offers of assistance from the community, Bathilda maintained a fierce independence, adapting to her changing capabilities rather than accepting help that might compromise her privacy or working methods.

It was in this gradually declining state that Harry Potter and Hermione Granger found the cottage during their search for information about the mysterious symbol of the Deathly Hallows in December 1997. By this time, unknown to the wizarding community, Bathilda had already been killed and her body possessed by Nagini as part of Voldemort's trap for Harry. The cottage they entered was a disturbing shadow of its former intellectual vibrancy—dark, neglected, permeated with the odor of decay both literal and metaphorical.

The tragic events that unfolded there—Nagini's attack on Harry and the narrow escape of both young wizards—marked the nadir of the cottage's long history. For months afterward, the building stood abandoned, its remarkable contents vulnerable to the elements and potential looting. Only through the intervention of Professor McGonagall, who had been both student and friend to Bathilda, were preservation charms placed around the property until proper arrangements could be made following Voldemort's defeat.

In the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, the cottage became the subject of considerable debate regarding its future. Some advocated for its preservation as a historical site related to both Bathilda's scholarly contributions and the pivotal wartime events that occurred there. Others, particularly residents of Godric's Hollow, expressed concern about attracting dark tourism to a village already receiving numerous visitors to the Potter memorial.

Ultimately, a compromise was reached that honored both Bathilda's legacy and the village's character. The cottage was carefully restored and transformed into a small research center housing Bathilda's library and archives. Access was limited to accredited magical historians and approved advanced students, preventing the site from becoming a general tourist attraction while ensuring the preservation of its intellectual treasures.

A modest plaque beside the gate acknowledges both Bathilda's contributions to wizarding scholarship and the tragedy of her death, serving as a subtle marker for those who understand its significance without drawing undue attention from Muggle residents or casual visitors. The compromised solution reflects the village's enduring character as a place where magical and non-magical worlds coexist through mutual accommodation and respectful boundaries.

Perhaps most fitting, the cottage's garden was restored according to Bathilda's original designs, with specific plants selected to represent different historical periods in wizarding Britain. Each spring, white lilies bloom beneath the study window—planted originally in friendship with Lily Potter, maintained now in memory of both remarkable witches whose lives intertwined with the cottage's long history.

Today, as one passes the unassuming stone dwelling on the eastern edge of Godric's Hollow, it appears much as it did during Bathilda's prime—roses climbing the weathered walls, smoke curling from the chimney, lamplight glowing warmly through leaded windows. Behind that ordinary façade, however, new generations of magical historians carefully examine the extraordinary collection of knowledge assembled over one remarkable witch's lifetime, ensuring that Bathilda Bagshot's commitment to preserving and understanding the past continues to illuminate wizarding society's path forward.

As our candle burns low and night deepens around us, consider how our dwellings become extensions of ourselves, repositories of our knowledge and witnesses to our lives. What stories might the walls of your own home tell, and what treasures of wisdom or memory would future visitors find most revealing about the life you've lived within them?
