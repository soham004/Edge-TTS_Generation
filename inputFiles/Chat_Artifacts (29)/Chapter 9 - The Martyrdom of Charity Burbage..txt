Chapter 9: The Martyrdom of Charity Burbage.

Some lights shine brightest against the darkest backdrop. As our candle flickers in the deepening night, casting gentle shadows across these ancient volumes, let us turn our attention to a witch whose courage and convictions led her to stand against the tide of hatred, even as darkness rose once more in the wizarding world. Tonight, we honor the memory of Professor Charity Burbage, whose life and death embody both the noblest aspirations and most tragic moments of recent wizarding history.

Before her name became associated with martyrdom, Charity Burbage was known as an enthusiastic educator with an unusually progressive worldview. Born in 1954 to a wizarding family with historical ties to both magical and Muggle communities, Charity's early exposure to both worlds shaped her lifelong perspective on wizard-Muggle relations.

As a student at Hogwarts in the late 1960s, young Charity was sorted into Hufflepuff House, where her natural empathy, inclusiveness, and steadfast dedication to fairness flourished. Fellow students from that era recall her remarkable ability to form friendships across house boundaries—a quality that would later serve her well as an educator seeking to bridge even greater divides.

Her academic record showed particular strength in History of Magic and Muggle Studies, with Professor Quirinus Quirrell (then teaching Muggle Studies before his fateful sabbatical and encounter with Lord Voldemort) noting her "exceptional ability to analyze magical culture through comparative perspectives." Even in her youth, Charity demonstrated the intellectual framework that would define her professional approach—examining wizarding traditions not in isolation but as part of broader human cultural development.

After completing her education at Hogwarts, Burbage pursued advanced studies in Anthropological Magic at the Magical University of Edinburgh, a small but respected institution known for its progressive approach to magical theory. Her doctoral research examined how Muggle technological innovations had influenced wizarding cultural development despite official policies of separation—a controversial topic that established her reputation as a forward-thinking scholar.

When Quirrell vacated the Muggle Studies position at Hogwarts to pursue his ill-fated interest in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Burbage was Dumbledore's immediate choice as replacement. She arrived at Hogwarts as a professor in 1991—coincidentally the same year Harry Potter began his education at the school.

As Muggle Studies professor, Charity completely transformed the curriculum. Where previous instruction had often presented Muggle life as a curiosity—something to be viewed with bemused interest but fundamental separation—Burbage emphasized interconnection and mutual influence. Her classroom featured working Muggle devices alongside magical equivalents, demonstrating how similar needs had led to parallel development of solutions in both communities.

Students who elected to take her class frequently described it as "eye-opening," regardless of their family background. Pure-blood students encountered thoughtful explanations of Muggle innovation that challenged ingrained assumptions about non-magical capabilities, while Muggle-born students gained new appreciation for how their birth culture had shaped magical society in subtle but profound ways.

"Professor Burbage made us understand that separation doesn't mean superiority," recalled Penelope Clearwater, a former student. "She could explain electricity in ways that made it seem just as impressive as any charm, just operating by different principles."

Beyond merely teaching facts about Muggle life, Charity challenged her students to examine the ethical dimensions of wizard-Muggle relations. Her fifth-year curriculum included critical discussions of the International Statute of Secrecy—not questioning its necessity, but examining its implementation and consequences from multiple perspectives. She encouraged students to consider complex questions: What responsibilities did the wizarding world have toward Muggles? How might magical solutions help address Muggle challenges without violating separation? What values did both communities share despite their differences?

These questions became increasingly relevant—and increasingly dangerous to ask—as the 1990s progressed and the shadow of Voldemort's return lengthened across magical Britain.

Charity's teaching extended beyond her classroom. She regularly contributed thoughtful articles to wizarding publications, particularly addressing misconceptions about Muggles and advocating for greater understanding between magical and non-magical communities. Her writing style combined scholarly rigor with accessible warmth, making complex sociological concepts understandable to the average witch or wizard.

In the staffroom at Hogwarts, colleagues remembered her as unfailingly kind but intellectually formidable. She formed a particularly close friendship with Minerva McGonagall, despite their different academic disciplines, bonding over shared values of fairness and intellectual integrity. Filius Flitwick recalled how Charity would often engage Severus Snape in nuanced debates about magical theory, seemingly undeterred by his forbidding demeanor. In retrospect, these conversations take on additional poignancy considering Snape's later anguish at being unable to prevent her murder.

As tensions rose following Voldemort's return, Charity's position became increasingly precarious. Pure-blood supremacist ideology fundamentally contradicted everything she taught and believed. Her classroom became a space of resistance—not through overt political statements, but through the radical act of teaching empathy, understanding, and the fundamental equality of all humans, magical or not.

In early June 1997, just weeks before Dumbledore's death would mark the beginning of open conflict, Charity published what would become her final article in the Daily Prophet. The piece, titled "Muggles Not So Different," directly challenged the ideological foundations of blood supremacy. She argued that the increasing numbers of Muggle-born witches and wizards had "enriched and benefited" wizarding society, and that many pure-blood families "denied their squib relatives" to maintain an illusion of magical purity.

Most controversially, she explicitly endorsed magical-Muggle intermarriage, writing that such unions should be "celebrated for expanding magical understanding and helping integrate those born to magic with the non-magical world." In the context of rising blood-purism, these were not merely academic positions but direct challenges to the ideology Voldemort promoted.

Following Dumbledore's death and the hidden infiltration of the Ministry of Magic by Voldemort's supporters, Charity recognized the growing danger of her position. Friends urged her to flee abroad until the political situation stabilized. According to those who spoke with her during those final weeks, she seriously considered leaving but ultimately decided that abandoning her principles in the face of threat would undermine everything she had taught her students about moral courage.

In mid-July 1997, as she prepared materials for what she hoped would be another academic year, Death Eaters tracked Charity to her modest home in North Yorkshire. The exact details of her capture remain unclear, though the property showed signs of a significant magical struggle. What is known with certainty is that she was taken directly to Malfoy Manor, which was serving as Voldemort's headquarters.

The events that followed are known primarily through the reluctant testimony of witnesses present at Malfoy Manor during that dark period. Suspended above the long polished table in the manor's drawing room, where Voldemort held court surrounded by his followers, Charity Burbage made a final, desperate appeal to the one person present whom she believed might still harbor humanity.

"Severus, please," she begged, looking to the man who had been her colleague for six years. "We're friends."

Those present reported that Snape's face remained "blank, emotionless" as he sat directly beneath her, maintaining the perfect deception that would ultimately help bring about Voldemort's downfall. Whether Charity understood in her final moments that Snape's apparent betrayal masked a deeper loyalty to Dumbledore's cause remains unknown.

Lord Voldemort, with casual cruelty that horrified even some of his followers, declared to the assembled Death Eaters that Professor Burbage "taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles... how they are not so different from us." With the twisted logic of supremacist ideology, he presented her progressive views as corruption and her advocacy for understanding as pollution of magical heritage.

With a flash of green light from the Elder Wand, Charity Burbage's life ended. In a final indignity demonstrating the complete dehumanization at the core of Voldemort's ideology, her body was fed to Nagini, the great serpent, as the assembled Death Eaters watched in horror or approval according to their true natures.

News of Charity's disappearance reached the wizarding public through a small notice in the Daily Prophet—by then already under Death Eater influence—stating merely that she had "resigned from her post." No mention was made of her murder or the circumstances surrounding it. For many within the wizarding community, the truth about her fate would not become known until after Voldemort's ultimate defeat.

In the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, Charity Burbage's legacy emerged as a powerful symbol of resistance through education and moral conviction. Her murder represented not just personal tragedy but an attack on the very values of tolerance, understanding, and human dignity that defined her life's work.

The post-war Ministry of Magic, under Minister Shacklebolt's leadership, posthumously awarded Charity the Order of Merlin, First Class—the highest honor in wizarding society—recognizing that she had died defending the fundamental principles upon which a just magical community must be built. The citation specifically acknowledged her as "a casualty in the struggle against hatred and division, whose classroom formed a frontline in the battle for wizarding hearts and minds."

At Hogwarts, a memorial to Professor Burbage was established in the corridor outside the Muggle Studies classroom. Rather than a somber stone monument, the memorial takes the form of a small interactive exhibit featuring both magical and Muggle inventions side by side, demonstrating the parallel ingenuity of both communities—a physical manifestation of the connections she had always taught.

Perhaps most meaningfully, the Muggle Studies curriculum she developed, temporarily suppressed during the Death Eaters' control of Hogwarts, was reinstated and expanded after the war. The subject was made mandatory for all students through their fifth year, ensuring that every young witch and wizard would receive education specifically countering the prejudices that had fueled two wizarding wars.

Former students established the Charity Burbage Scholarship Fund, providing financial support for projects promoting understanding between magical and non-magical communities. Recipients have included researchers developing magical solutions to Muggle environmental challenges, historians documenting shared cultural heritage, and educators creating resources for wizarding children growing up in increasingly integrated communities.

The significance of Charity Burbage's life and death extends beyond her individual tragedy to illuminate broader truths about resistance to totalitarian ideology. In times of darkness, education becomes either a powerful tool of oppression or a vital force for resistance. By teaching empathy, critical thinking, and the recognition of common humanity across apparent differences, Charity represented the transformative potential of education to undermine the foundations of hatred.

Her story reminds us that courage manifests not only in dramatic battlefield heroics but in the quiet, persistent defense of truth and human dignity. Charity did not die fighting with wand in hand, but she died because she refused to abandon the principles she taught, even when teaching them became dangerous. In this, she embodied the words Dumbledore once shared with Harry Potter: "It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."

As the embers in our fireplace gradually dim and night deepens around us, consider how ideas taught in classrooms may ultimately prove as powerful as any spell in shaping the world. What lessons might we learn from Charity Burbage's unwavering commitment to understanding across differences, and how might her example guide us as we navigate our own encounters with those whose experiences differ from our own?
