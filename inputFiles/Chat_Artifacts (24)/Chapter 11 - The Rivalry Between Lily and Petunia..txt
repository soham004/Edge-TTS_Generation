Chapter 11: The Rivalry Between Lily and Petunia.

The hearth glows with gentle amber light as we turn our attention to a relationship as old as human experience itself – that of sisters. In the quiet suburb of Cokeworth, many years before the Boy Who Lived would sleep in a cupboard beneath the stairs, two girls shared a childhood that would ultimately diverge into paths so separate that the magical and mundane worlds themselves seemed to keep them apart. The story of Lily and Petunia Evans offers us a poignant glimpse into how the wizarding world both creates and severs bonds of family.

Picture, if you will, a modest brick home on an ordinary street. Inside, two young girls with matching blonde dolls play beneath a window where afternoon light streams in geometric patterns across a clean-swept floor. The older girl, her hair straight and her posture already carrying the rigid propriety that would define her adult years, carefully arranges her doll's dress with meticulous attention to how things should be. The younger sister, with startlingly green eyes that seem to contain their own light, watches as her doll's hair suddenly changes color without explanation – one of many inexplicable occurrences that surround her like an invisible aura.

Before magic entered their lives, Lily and Petunia Evans shared the ordinary closeness of sisters. Family photographs from this time show two girls with their arms around each other, gap-toothed smiles revealing nothing of the rift that would eventually divide them. They shared secrets, clothes, and the special language of siblings that exists beyond words. Petunia, as the elder, naturally assumed the role of protector and guide, teaching Lily how to tie her shoes and helping her navigate the social complexities of primary school.

Their parents, while never wealthy, provided a stable and loving home where both girls received equal affection and attention. Mr. Evans worked steadily at the local factory, while Mrs. Evans maintained their modest home with an eye for making ordinary things beautiful – a talent for transforming the mundane that Lily would inherit in her own magical way. In this environment, the sisters flourished, their differences complementary rather than divisive.

The first indications of the change to come appeared subtly. Objects would move when Lily became emotional. Flowers would bloom out of season beneath her bedroom window. At night, the shadows on her walls sometimes formed shapes that seemed to dance to unheard music. Petunia, with her practical nature and desire for normalcy, initially explained away these occurrences, but as they increased in frequency and obviousness, she could no longer deny that something about her sister was fundamentally different.

As the fire crackles softly, casting warm shadows across this chamber, consider the moment that truly began the sisters' divergence – the day a boy with lank black hair and ill-fitting clothes watched Lily from behind a bush at the local playground. Severus Snape, himself a wizard child living in the same industrial town, recognized in Lily what her family could not – the unmistakable signs of magical ability. His revelation to her that she was a witch, that her strange abilities were not abnormalities but gifts, would forever alter the relationship between the Evans sisters.

For Lily, Snape's explanation provided answers to questions she had long harbored about her own nature. The validation that she was not strange but special, not abnormal but extraordinary, offered both relief and excitement. A whole world previously hidden now opened before her, filled with possibilities beyond her wildest imagination. Her natural curiosity and warmth of character made her eager to embrace this newfound identity.

For Petunia, however, Snape's revelation represented something altogether different – the beginning of exclusion. The special bond she had shared with her sister now faced interference from an outside force she could neither understand nor access. When she observed Lily and Severus huddled together, whispering about magical theory and wizarding customs, she experienced the first pangs of the jealousy that would eventually harden into resentment.

The playground incident where Severus caused a branch to fall on Petunia when she was eavesdropping on his conversations with Lily marked a significant escalation. This wasn't merely being excluded from a game or a secret – this was being actively repelled by forces beyond her comprehension. The humiliation of that moment stayed with Petunia, crystallizing her growing sense that magic represented not wonder but danger, not advancement but abnormality.

As you settle more comfortably before our evening fire, imagine Petunia's perspective when Lily's Hogwarts letter arrived. The official parchment with its green ink and wax seal represented incontrovertible proof that her sister belonged to a world from which she would forever be barred. The pride in her parents' eyes as they read about this prestigious school that had selected their daughter magnified Petunia's sense of inadequacy. In a family that had always emphasized equality between the sisters, a fundamental inequality had emerged that no amount of parental fairness could erase.

What followed reveals the depths of Petunia's desperation to maintain the connection with her sister. In a moment of vulnerability rarely seen in her later years, young Petunia wrote directly to Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, pleading to be admitted to Hogwarts alongside Lily. This extraordinary act – reaching across the boundary between Muggle and magical worlds – demonstrated how desperately she wished to avoid the separation she saw looming before them.

Dumbledore's response, while kind, was necessarily firm – Hogwarts could only accept students with magical ability. His gentle rejection, however well-intentioned, served only to deepen Petunia's wound. That Lily discovered this correspondence and confronted her sister about it added humiliation to disappointment. For perhaps the first time, Petunia experienced the bitter taste of being pitied by her younger sister – a reversal of their natural dynamic that she found intolerable.

When September first arrived and Lily departed for Hogwarts from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, the physical separation reflected the emotional distance already growing between the sisters. Petunia's refusal to accompany the family to the station marked her first deliberate step away from the magical world that had claimed her sister. While Mr. and Mrs. Evans waved tearful goodbyes to Lily, Petunia remained at home, beginning the process of building walls around her heart that would eventually become impenetrable.

The pattern of their relationship during Lily's Hogwarts years established the dynamic that would define their adult interactions. School holidays brought Lily home full of exciting stories about moving staircases, talking portraits, and spells that could transform teacups into turtles. Her trunk contained strange objects – quills instead of pens, robes instead of ordinary clothes, textbooks with moving images that Petunia refused to touch. Each magical artifact served as a reminder of the gulf between them.

Petunia's coping mechanism emerged in her exaggerated embrace of normalcy. If Lily would be extraordinary, Petunia would be extraordinarily ordinary. She developed an almost obsessive interest in conventional achievements – perfect marks in conventional subjects, impeccable housekeeping skills, knowledge of proper etiquette for every social situation. She began to speak disparagingly of "her sort" when referring to Lily and other magical individuals, creating linguistic distance to match the emotional separation she felt.

The summer after Lily's fifth year at Hogwarts marked a particularly difficult period in their relationship. Lily had achieved exceptional O.W.L. results and received a prefect badge, accomplishments that delighted their parents. Petunia, meanwhile, had been accepted to a secretarial college – a respectable achievement in the Muggle world that seemed pale in comparison to her sister's magical honors. The contrast in their parents' reactions, though subtle, reinforced Petunia's perception that ordinary accomplishments would always be overshadowed by magical ones.

It was during this summer that the sisters had what witnesses described as their most heated argument. Though details remain scarce, the dispute apparently began when Petunia discovered Lily practicing Charms homework in their shared bedroom. Words were exchanged about "abnormality" and "jealousy," culminating in Petunia's pronouncement that she had no desire to be a "freak." The door between them, both literally and figuratively, remained closed for days afterward.

Their parents' attempts to mediate this growing rift largely failed, as they lacked the context to fully understand its nature. Well-meaning suggestions that the girls "just get along" or "appreciate each other's differences" could not address the fundamental inequality that magic had introduced into their relationship. Mr. and Mrs. Evans, loving both daughters equally, found themselves increasingly caught between worlds they couldn't reconcile.

Perhaps the clearest illustration of how far the sisters had drifted apart came when Petunia met Vernon Dursley during her secretarial studies. In Vernon, Petunia found everything the magical world was not – predictable, conventional, solidly anchored in the material reality she understood. His complete lack of imagination and absolute devotion to normality represented a deliberate counterpoint to the chaotic wonder of Lily's world. That Vernon found Petunia's increasingly rigid personality and obsession with appearances attractive further validated her chosen path.

When Lily met Vernon during a holiday gathering, the encounter proved disastrous. Vernon, informed about Lily's "boarding school" but nothing of its magical nature, attempted to impress her with mundane accomplishments – his company car, his prospects at Grunnings drill company, his sensible investments. Lily, trying to engage politely but finding little common ground, eventually mentioned something about the wizarding economy that left Vernon spluttering in confusion. The evening ended with Vernon red-faced and Petunia in tears, the chasm between the sisters wider than ever.

Shortly thereafter, Lily brought James Potter home to meet her family. James, despite his best efforts to appear Muggle-appropriate, could not hide his essentially magical nature. His fascination with ordinary electrical appliances, his slip-ups in conversation about "flying" to visit his parents, his wand barely concealed in his jacket pocket – all confirmed Petunia's worst perceptions about wizards. That James and Lily were obviously deeply in love only intensified Petunia's resentment, as her relationship with Vernon seemed pale and pragmatic by comparison.

The sisters' weddings, occurring within months of each other, epitomized their divergent paths. Petunia's was meticulously conventional – a white church wedding with precisely twenty-five guests per side, a three-tiered cake decorated with sugar flowers, and a rehearsed first dance to an inoffensive popular song. Lily attended with James, both making a concerted effort to blend in, though James' attempts to compliment the vicar on his "costume" nearly caused a scene.

Lily's wedding, by contrast, incorporated both Muggle and magical elements out of respect for her parents. Enchanted butterflies that dissolved into showers of light, a cake with miniature figures that moved when no one was looking directly at them, and music from instruments that played themselves when the band took breaks. Petunia attended with palpable discomfort, refusing Vernon's arm during the magical portions of the ceremony and departing before the reception reached its peak.

The final break between the sisters coincided with the darkening of the wizarding world as Lord Voldemort's power grew. Lily and James became increasingly involved in the resistance against him, their lives constantly in danger. Petunia, now pregnant with Dudley, retreated further into the safe predictability of Privet Drive. Their communication dwindled to Christmas cards and occasional stiff telephone calls characterized more by what remained unsaid than what was expressed.

When Lily gave birth to Harry, she sent a birth announcement to Petunia. In return, Petunia mailed a vase – ordinary, mass-produced, and notably inexpensive compared to the Dursleys' financial comfort. This cold acknowledgment represented the last direct communication between the sisters before tragedy struck the Potter family.

The night Lily and James were murdered, Petunia opened her door to find her sister's son on her doorstep. Dumbledore's letter explaining Lily's sacrifice and the blood protection that now connected Harry to his aunt confronted Petunia with the ultimate consequence of the magical world she had rejected – it had claimed her sister completely. In accepting Harry, however reluctantly, Petunia acknowledged the bond of family that persisted despite everything that had divided them.

In the years that followed, Petunia's treatment of Harry revealed the complexity of her feelings toward her sister. Her resentment, transferred to Lily's son, manifested in neglect and occasional cruelty. Yet she maintained the blood protection by keeping him under her roof, fulfilling the bare minimum of her obligation to her sister's memory. In rare unguarded moments – when Harry inadvertently displayed Lily's mannerisms or when her green eyes looked out from his face – Petunia's expression suggested the pain of loss beneath her bitterness.

As our fire dims to gentle embers and shadows lengthen across these ancient stones, we realize that the story of Lily and Petunia reveals something profound about the intersection of the magical and Muggle worlds. Their estrangement represents more than sibling rivalry; it illuminates the inevitable separations that occur when magical ability divides families. From the Blacks to the Dumbledores, from the Creevy brothers to the Evans sisters, wizarding history is filled with such divisions – magical children set apart from their non-magical relatives by abilities that can neither be learned nor transferred.

Yet even in their estrangement, an unbreakable connection remained between Lily and Petunia. In her final moments, Lily's thoughts turned to protecting her son. In her grudging acceptance of Harry, Petunia honored that sacrifice in the only way she could comprehend. The blood protection that flowed through their shared lineage transcended their differences, creating a magic deeper than any taught at Hogwarts – the magic of family bonds that persist even when everything else would pull them apart.

As night settles fully around us and the last light fades from our chamber, consider this question: In a world divided between magical and Muggle, what responsibilities do those blessed with magical ability bear toward those without? And how might understanding the story of Lily and Petunia help us bridge the divisions – magical or mundane – that separate us from those who should be closest to our hearts?
