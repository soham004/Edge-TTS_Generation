Chapter 5: Why Neville Was The REAL Chosen One All Along.

Prophecies whisper their secrets in shadowed halls, their meanings never quite as clear as they first appear. Tonight, as starlight filters through our window and the world grows quiet, let us contemplate one of the most intriguing alternative readings of the wizarding world's central prophecy—that perhaps Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the true Chosen One destined to vanquish the Dark Lord.

The theory begins, as it must, with the prophecy itself. Spoken by Sybill Trelawney to Albus Dumbledore in the Hog's Head tavern, its words set in motion the events that would shape the wizarding world for decades to come: "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies..."

These words could have applied equally to two boys born at the end of July 1980: Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. Both sets of parents—James and Lily Potter, Frank and Alice Longbottom—were Aurors who had indeed "thrice defied" Lord Voldemort in the First Wizarding War. Both boys were born as July came to a close—Harry on the 31st, Neville just the day before on the 30th.

The conventional understanding, of course, is that Voldemort himself designated Harry as his equal by attempting to kill him, thereby fulfilling another line of the prophecy: "and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal." The lightning scar became the physical manifestation of this marking, setting Harry irrevocably on the path toward their final confrontation.

But what if we've misunderstood the nature of this marking? What if the choice was not truly Voldemort's to make? Consider the words of Dumbledore to Harry in "Order of the Phoenix": "Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!"

This suggests a deeper truth—that prophecies do not dictate events but rather describe possibilities. The power ultimately lies in the choices made by those involved. When Voldemort chose to target Harry based on the partial prophecy reported by Severus Snape, he set in motion a self-fulfilling prophecy. But what if his choice was arbitrary, or worse, incorrect?

Imagine for a moment that we set aside the conventional interpretation. The marking need not be physical. Consider instead how both boys were "marked" by Voldemort's actions. Harry lost his parents and gained a scar. Neville's parents were tortured into insanity by Voldemort's followers, leaving him effectively orphaned as well. Both boys grew up without their parents' guidance because of Voldemort's reign of terror. Both were marked by loss and suffering.

The phrase "mark him as his equal" takes on new meaning when we consider that Voldemort, himself a half-blood raised without parents, created through his actions two boys with parallel childhood traumas. In this reading, both Harry and Neville were marked, both were potential Chosen Ones, equal candidates to fulfill the prophecy.

What makes this theory particularly compelling is how Neville's narrative arc shadows Harry's throughout the series, creating a pattern of parallel development that suggests two potential heroes, not just one.

Consider their beginnings at Hogwarts. Both boys arrive somewhat unprepared for the wizarding world—Harry because of his upbringing with Muggles, Neville because of his family's fear that he might be a Squib. Both possess wands with significant connections—Harry's shares a core with Voldemort's, while Neville initially uses his father's wand, creating a connection to the parent he lost to the war.

Their first-year experiences establish them as opposite sides of the same coin. When Malfoy steals Neville's Remembrall during flying lessons, it's Harry who recovers it, demonstrating his natural flying ability. Later, when Harry, Hermione, and Ron lose 150 points for Gryffindor, it's Neville who stands up to them, showing the courage that would later define him. The Sorting Hat's decisions for both boys are telling—it briefly considers Slytherin for Harry, while Neville begs to be placed in Hufflepuff, each showing uncertainty about their true nature.

As the series progresses, their parallel development continues. In "Chamber of Secrets," while Harry discovers his Parseltongue ability (unwittingly revealing his connection to Voldemort), Neville struggles with basic magic, seeming to confirm his status as a marginal character. Yet even this apparent weakness becomes significant—Neville's initial magical difficulties mirror Harry's struggles with Occlumency later in the series. Both boys have areas where their magic falters, suggesting comparable but different paths of development.

"Prisoner of Azkaban" brings another layer of symmetry. Harry confronts the specter of his parents' betrayer in Sirius Black (initially believing him guilty), while Neville lives with the knowledge that Bellatrix Lestrange, who tortured his parents, remains imprisoned in Azkaban. Both boys carry the weight of their parents' fates, their present lives shadowed by past violence.

By "Goblet of Fire," subtle indications of Neville's importance emerge. Professor Moody (actually Barty Crouch Jr., one of those responsible for torturing Neville's parents) takes special interest in Neville, giving him books on magical plants—knowledge that would later prove crucial to Harry's Triwizard Tournament success. This moment is doubly significant when we consider that Crouch Jr., a Death Eater who participated in the attack on the Longbottoms, unwittingly helps prepare Neville for his future role.

The Department of Mysteries battle in "Order of the Phoenix" marks a turning point for both boys. Harry goes seeking to save his godfather; Neville accompanies him out of loyalty. Both encounter the prophecy orb that connects them—the physical record of the words that tied their fates together before they were born. And most significantly, both face Bellatrix Lestrange, the witch who represents for Neville what Voldemort represents for Harry—the architect of his personal tragedy.

As we move into "Half-Blood Prince," their paths continue to reflect each other. While Harry receives private lessons from Dumbledore about Voldemort's past, Neville quietly develops his own strength, his determination forged by the previous year's battle. When the call comes to reform Dumbledore's Army during "Deathly Hallows," it is Neville who steps into the leadership role at Hogwarts while Harry pursues his mission outside the school.

This parallel development culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts, where Neville's role becomes unmistakably significant. When Harry appears dead and hope seems lost, it is Neville who stands against Voldemort, declaring continued resistance. And in a moment that perfectly balances Harry's confrontation with Voldemort, Neville destroys the final Horcrux, Nagini, using the Sword of Gryffindor—the same weapon Harry used to destroy the first Horcrux, the diary, years earlier.

This parallelism suggests something profound about the prophecy—perhaps its fulfillment required not one Chosen One but two: Harry to destroy Voldemort himself, and Neville to ensure that Voldemort could be destroyed by eliminating Nagini. Neither could have succeeded without the other, making them co-fulfillments of the prophecy rather than alternative candidates.

But the theory that Neville was the true Chosen One goes deeper still when we consider the nature of prophecy itself in the wizarding world. Divination is repeatedly portrayed as an imprecise art, open to interpretation and influenced by the choices of those involved. As Dumbledore tells Harry, "Prophecies only become significant when people make them significant."

What if Voldemort, in choosing to target Harry based on the partial prophecy, simply chose wrong? What if Neville was always the one truly destined to vanquish him? This reading casts Harry's role in a new light—not as the prophesied savior but as the unexpected variable, the element Voldemort never accounted for in his calculations.

Consider the moment when Neville pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat during the final battle. This mirrors Harry's retrieval of the sword from the hat in the Chamber of Secrets, suggesting that both boys were equally worthy Gryffindors, equally capable of wielding this powerful artifact that presents itself only to the worthy. The sword, which takes in only that which makes it stronger, accepts both boys as wielders, suggesting a fundamental equality between them.

There's a beautiful symmetry to the idea that while Voldemort obsessed over Harry, the true threat to his power was quietly developing elsewhere, overlooked and underestimated. Neville's transformation from a forgetful, magically awkward boy to the defiant leader who declares "I'll join you when hell freezes over" to Voldemort himself becomes not just a satisfying character arc but the fulfillment of a destiny.

The theory gains additional support from the way Neville's confidence and magical ability blossom once he obtains his own wand after the Department of Mysteries battle. His previous use of his father's wand—a wand that hadn't chosen him—had impeded his magical development. With his own wand, selected specifically for him, Neville's true power emerges. This mirrors Harry's special connection with his wand, suggesting again that both boys had similar potential that manifested in different ways.

If we accept this theory, certain events take on new significance. The prophecy's wording—"either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives"—traditionally interpreted as referring to Harry and Voldemort, could instead describe Neville and Voldemort. Neville's parents, though alive physically, could not truly "live" in their state of insanity while Voldemort's ideology survived. Conversely, Voldemort's vision for the wizarding world could not be realized while people like Neville survived to oppose him.

Even Neville's affinity for Herbology, often seen merely as a character trait, gains prophetic significance. Plants represent growth, renewal, and the natural cycle of death and rebirth—themes central to Voldemort's defeat. Neville's skill with living things stands in stark contrast to Voldemort's affinity for death and stagnation. Where Voldemort sought to conquer death through artificial means, Neville understood and worked with the natural world.

Perhaps most compelling is the way this theory transforms our understanding of choice and destiny in the wizarding world. If both Harry and Neville were potential Chosen Ones, then the prophecy didn't dictate a single fixed future but outlined multiple possibilities. The true outcome was determined not by fate alone but by the choices made by everyone involved—Voldemort in targeting Harry, Dumbledore in protecting both boys in different ways, and ultimately Harry and Neville themselves in choosing to stand against darkness.

This reading doesn't diminish Harry's role or courage but rather expands our understanding of heroism in the story. Harry and Neville become complementary heroes, each fulfilling different aspects of the prophecy, each crucial to Voldemort's ultimate defeat. Where Harry brought the direct confrontation, the spectacular clash of opposed forces, Neville provided the quiet strength, the unexpected resistance that proved equally necessary.

As we near the conclusion of our exploration, another layer emerges—the symbolic significance of Neville's name. "Longbottom" suggests deep roots, endurance, steadfastness—qualities Neville embodies throughout the series. "Neville" derives from Norman French, meaning "new town" or "new settlement," perhaps foreshadowing his role in building the new wizarding world that would emerge after Voldemort's defeat. Names have power in the wizarding world, and Neville's suggests a hero who endures and then helps create something new from the ashes of conflict.

The conventional narrative tells us that Harry was the Chosen One because Voldemort chose him, marking him with the lightning scar. But this theory invites us to consider a more complex interpretation—that the true fulfillment of the prophecy required both boys, each marked in different ways, each bringing different strengths to the final confrontation. Perhaps the prophecy was never about a single Chosen One but about the unexpected ways destiny manifests across multiple lives.

As the night deepens and our theoretical journey draws to a close, I invite you to consider this question: in a world where prophecies speak of possibilities rather than certainties, where choice shapes destiny as much as destiny shapes choice, might the true power to vanquish darkness lie not in being the chosen one, but in choosing to act as though you are? And if so, what does Neville's journey from frightened first-year to sword-wielding defender of Hogwarts teach us about the nature of courage, destiny, and the quiet power of those whom history does not immediately recognize as heroes?
